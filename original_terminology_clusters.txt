Changes:
 - Renamed and merged clusters:
 	- 0 -> Autobiographical Self
	- 1 -> Performance Profile
	- 2 -> Episodic Memory
	- 3 -> Event Records
	- 4 -> History
	- 5 -> Mental State
	- 6 -> Experience
	- 7 -> Reasoning Trace
	- 8 -> Representation
	- 9 -> (merged with Cluster 8)
	- 10 -> Problem-solving Trace
	- 11 -> Processing Trace
- New Cluster:
	- Data
- Moved Terms:
	- "mental state" from "Experience" to "Mental state"
	- "metacognitive experience" from "Episodic Memory" to "Metacognitive Experience"
	- "representations of mental states" from "Metacognitive Experiences" to "Representation" and "Mental State"	- 	- "internal experience" from "History" to "Metacognitive Experiences"
	- "meta-Information" from "Mental State" to "Data"
- Copied Terms:
	- "autobiographical data", "telemetry", "traces of data through the processing pipeline" to "Data"
	- "experience memory replay", "experiential Event streams" -> "Experience"
	- "autobiographical memory" -> "Episodic Memory"
	- "self-model" -> representation
	- "contextualized process performance history" to "History"
	- "traces of the system's inference activity" to "Reasoning Trace"
