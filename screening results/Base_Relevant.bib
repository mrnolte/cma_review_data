In this paper we describe a novel rule-based architecture of metamemory named M2-Acch. M2-Acch consists of a cycle of reasoning about events that occur in long-term memory (LTM) in an intelligent tutoring system. M2-Acch is composed of a three layer structure: static layer, functional layer and information layer. The structural components of each layer model are described using formal definitions. M2-Acch uses confidence judgments for recommending search strategies for adaptation to changes in the information retrieval constraints. An intelligent tutoring system named FUNPRO was implemented and validated. The results of the experimental tests show that M2-Acch can be used as a valid tool for adapting to changes}},

To assemble such an agent, it is necessary to perform a full integration of cognition (planning, understanding, and learning) and metacognition (control and monitoring of cognition) with intelligent behaviors. The failure to do this completely is why similar, more limited efforts have not succeeded in the past. I outline some key computational requirements of metacognition by describing a multi- strategy learning system called Meta-AQUA and then discuss an integration of Meta-AQUA with a nonlinear state-space planning agent. I show how the resultant system, INTRO, can independently generate its own goals, and I relate this work to the general issue of self-awareness by machine.}},

note = {{Description: Metacognition has been used in artificial intelligence to increase the level of autonomy of intelligent systems. However, the design of systems with metacognitive capabilities is a difficult task due to the number and complexity of processes involved. The main objective of this article is to introduce a novel metacognitive architecture for monitoring and control of reasoning failures in artificial intelligent agents. CARINA metacognitive architecture is based on precise definitions of structural and functional elements of metacognition as defined in the MISM meta-model. CARINA can be used to implement real-world cognitive agents with the capability for introspective monitoring and meta-level control. Introspective monitoring detects reasoning failure (for example, when expectation is violated). Metacognitive control selects strategies to recover from failures. The article demonstrates a CARINA implementation of reasoning failure detection and recovery in an intelligent tutoring system called FUNPRO.}},
