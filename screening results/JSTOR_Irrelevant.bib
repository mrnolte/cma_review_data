 abstract = {This article considers the cognitive architecture of human meta-reasoning: that is, metacognition concerning one's own reasoning and decision-making. The view we defend is that meta-reasoning is a cobbled-together skill comprising diverse self-management strategies acquired through individual and cultural learning. These approximate the monitoring-and-control functions of a postulated adaptive system for metacognition by recruiting mechanisms that were designed for quite other purposes.},

 abstract = {Adaptive behaviour depends on the ability to introspect accurately about one's own performance. Whether this metacognitive ability is supported by the same mechanisms across different tasks is unclear. We investigated the relationship between metacognition of visual perception and metacognition of visual short-term memory (VSTM). Experiments 1 and 2 required subjects to estimate the perceived or remembered orientation of a grating stimulus and rate their confidence. We observed strong positive correlations between individual differences in metacognitive accuracy between the two tasks. This relationship was not accounted for by individual differences in task performance or average confidence, and was present across two different metrics of metacognition and in both experiments. A model-based analysis of data from a third experiment showed that a cross-domain correlation only emerged when both tasks shared the same task-relevant stimulus feature. That is, metacognition for perception and VSTM were correlated when both tasks required orientation judgements, but not when the perceptual task was switched to require contrast judgements. In contrast with previous results comparing perception and long-term memory, which have largely provided evidence for domain-specific metacognitive processes, the current findings suggest that metacognition of visual perception and VSTM is supported by a domaingeneral metacognitive architecture, but only when both domains share the same task-relevant stimulus feature.},

 abstract = {Recent work in cognitive neuroscience on the child's Theory of Mind (ToM) has pursued the idea that the ability to metarepresent mental states depends on a domain-specific cognitive subystem implemented in specific neural circuitry: a Theory of Mind Module. We argue that the interaction of several domain-general mechanisms and lower-level domain-specific mechanisms accounts for the flexibility and sophistication of behavior, which has been taken to be evidence for a domain-specific ToM module. This finding is of more general interest since it suggests a parsimonious cognitive architecture can account for apparent domain specificity. We argue for such an architecture in two stages. First, on conceptual grounds, contrasting the case of language with ToM, and second, by showing that recent evidence in the form of fMRI and lesion studies supports the more parsimonious hypothesis.},

 abstract = {Metacognition is regarded as a retrospective skill promoting learners’ learning performance, deep thinking, and academic well-being. Stimulated Recall (SR) is regarded as a reliable approach to inspiring learners’metacognition in the classroom. However, the outbreak of COVID-19, causing widespread class suspension, may impair the effect of SR on cultivating distance learners’metacognition. The current study, employing multi-mode stimuli of learners’eye movements and feedforward, aimed to develop the effect of SR on activating learners’metacognition in remote settings. Forty-eight university graduates were recruited to participate in an eye-tracking experiment using digital dictionaries. Their feedforward and eye movements were collected as multi-mode stimuli. By reviewing the consistency and discrepancies between their feedforward and eye movements, participants were invited to conduct an SR interview, which stimulated them to retrospect on their prior cognitive behaviors. The results of the metacognition scale pre-post test showed that learners’ metacognitive skills were significantly improved by the stimulated recall with multi-mode stimuli. The findings theoretically enrich the metacognition strategy in the Cognitive Theories of Multimedia Learning, and practically extend the implementation of stimulated recall in distance learning contexts.},

 abstract = {Metacognition, the ability to assess one's own knowledge, has been targeted as a critical learning mechanism in mathematics education. Yet the early childhood origins of metacognition have proven difficult to study. Using a novel nonverbal task and a comprehensive set of metacognitive measures, we provided the strongest evidence to date that young children are metacognitive. We showed that children as young as 5 years made metacognitive "bets" on their numerical discriminations in a wagering task. However, contrary to previous reports from adults, our results showed that children's metacognition is domain specific: Their metacognition in the numerical domain was unrelated to their metacognition in another domain (emotion discrimination). Moreover, children's metacognitive ability in only the numerical domain predicted their school-based mathematics knowledge. The data provide novel evidence that metacognition is a fundamental, domain-dependent cognitive ability in children. The findings have implications for theories of uncertainty and reveal new avenues for training metacognition in children.},

 abstract = {This Article presents a novel body of research in cognitive psychology called coherence-based reasoning, which has thus far been published in journals of experimental psychology. This cognitive approach challenges the stalemated conflict between the Rationalist and Critical models of decision making that have dominated legal scholarship for over a century. The experimental findings demonstrate that many legal decisions fit into neither of these models. Based on a connectionist cognitive architecture, coherence-based reasoning shows that the decision-making process progresses bidirectionally: premises and facts both determine conclusions and are affected by them in return. A natural result of this cognitive process is a skewing of the premises and facts toward inflated support for the chosen decision. The Article applies this research to four important aspects of the trial. It argues that the current doctrine in these areas is based on misconceptions about human cognition, which lead to systematic legal errors. By identifying the cognitive phenomena that lie at the root of these failings, the research makes it possible to devise interventions and introduce procedures that reduce the risk of trial error.},

 abstract = {Models of self-regulated learning emphasize the active and intentional role of learners and, thereby, focus mainly on conscious processes in working memory and long-term memory. Cognitive load theory supports this view on learning. As a result, both fields of research ignore the potential role of unconscious processes for learning. In this review paper, we propose an interactive layers model on self-regulated learning and cognitive load that considers sensory memory, working memory, and long-term memory. The model distinguishes between (a) unconscious self-regulated learning initiated by socalled resonant states in sensory memory and (b) conscious self-regulated learning of scheme construction in working memory. In contrast with conscious self-regulation, unconscious self-regulation induces no cognitive load. The model describes conscious and unconscious self-regulation in three different layers: a content layer, a learning strategy layer, and a metacognitive layer. Interactions of the three layers reflect processes of monitoring and control. We first substantiate the model based on a narrative review. Afterwards, we illustrate how the model contributes to re-interpretation of inconsistent empirical findings reported in the existing literature.},

Here, we demonstrated the opposite dissociation: a reliable relationship between confidence and judgment accuracy (demonstrating metacognition) despite judgment accuracy being no better than chance. We evaluated the judgments of 450 participants who completed an AGL task. For each trial, participants decided whether a stimulus conformed to a given set of rules and rated their confidence in that judgment. We identified participants who performed at chance on the discrimination task, utilizing a subset of their responses, and then assessed the accuracy and the confidence-accuracy relationship of their remaining responses. Analyses revealed above-chance metacognition among participants who did not exhibit decision accuracy. This important new phenomenon, which we term blind insight, poses critical challenges to prevailing models of metacognition grounded in signal detection theory.},

 abstract = {This study investigates the way that mothers and their preschool children divided up the strategic responsibilities for carrying out a problem-solving task which involves making a puzzle in accordance with a model. The interaction of 18 mother-child dyads was videotaped and analyzed for verbal and nonverbal devices used by the adult to regulate the child's behavior. The child's eye gaze to the model was used as a measure of how well he or she was following an effective strategy. It was found that with an increase in age there was a decrease in the proportion of these eye gazes that were regulated by the adult and thus an increase in self-regulated strategic behavior. In addition, it was found that when an older child looked at the model, he or she was likely to carry out the subsequent steps necessary to select a piece and insert it correctly and independently in the copy puzzle, whereas younger children were likely to need additional adult assistance after an eye gaze to the model. This is interpreted as suggesting that older children differed from younger ones in their understanding of the strategic significance of gaze behaviors and that the adults' communicative moves were fulfilling different functions for children at different ages. It is argued that an analysis of how adult-child dyads carry out tasks requiring strategic skills can result in a better understanding of the origins and development of these skills in independently functioning cognitive agents.},

 abstract = {Anthropomorphism, the attribution of human cognitive processes and emotional states to animals, is commonly viewed as non-scientific and potentially misleading. This is mainly because apparent similarity to humans can usually be explained by alternative, simpler mechanisms in animals, and because there is no explanatory power in analogies to human phenomena when these phenomena are not well understood. Yet, because it is also difficult to preclude real similarity and continuity in the evolution of humans' and animals' cognitive abilities, it may not be productive to completely ignore our understanding of human behaviour when thinking about animals. Here we propose that in applying a functional approach to the evolution of cognitive mechanisms, human cognition may be used to broaden our theoretical thinking and to generate testable hypotheses. Our goal is not to 'elevate' animals, but rather to find the mmimal set of mechanistic principles that may explain 'advanced' cognitive abilities in humans, and consider under what conditions these mechanisms were likely to enhance fitness and to evolve in animals. We illustrate this approach, from relatively simple emotional states, to more advanced mechanisms, involved in planning and decision-making, episodic memory, metacognition, theory of mind, and consciousness.},

Fifty-four students belonging to two eleventh grade courses from a public school in Bogotá - Colombia participated in the study. One of the student courses interacted with a hypermedia environment that contained, within its structure, the metacognitive scaffolding. The other course interacted with the hypermedia environment that did not have the scaffolding. Students were given the Embedded Figures Test (EFT) to classify them into field dependent, intermediate, and independent subjects. A Repeated Measures Analysis was conducted with two intra-subject variables: (1) CL and (2) LA. Findings indicate that significant differences exist between intrinsic and extraneous cognitive load because of the effect of the metacognitive scaffolding. Students that interacted with the metacognitive scaffolding exhibited significantly greater achievements than those that did not use it. The field independent students also exhibited significant differences in CL with respect to their field independent and intermediate classmates.},

An experimental research design was used in a study aimed at measuring the extent to which an APT’s affective feedback managed to enhance students’ self-reflection about what and how they had learned. Participants were a sample of 45 fourth-year high school students, who were divided into experimental and control groups (APT vs. human tutor) in a real online learning situation that involved metacognitive activities. A questionnaire was specifically designed to collect data from both groups. Our results showed that experimental group students achieved better scores in the self-reflection process, since the APT’s affective feedback significantly enhanced students’ conceptual change (what has changed with respect to their initial beliefs), as well as students’ personal growth and understanding (what led them to change their initial beliefs). They also indicated the affective competencies that the APT needs to have in order to achieve a conceptual and personal change in students.

 abstract = {ABSTRACT Instructional design theories such as the cognitive load theory (CLT) or the cognitive theory of multimedia learning (CTML) explain learning difficulties in (computer-based) learning usually as a result of design deficiencies that hinder effective schema construction. However, learners often struggle even in well-designed learning environments. In this theoretical paper, I will argue that cognitive resources-oriented theories such as the cognitive load theory might profit from extending their predominantly cognitive focus to one that additionally considers metacognitive and self-regulation demands. Empirical results on learning from multiple external representations and research on tool use are integrated to illustrate that computer-based learning environments usually pose a variety of cognitive, metacognitive and self-regulatory demands on learners which require knowledge and skills that learners often lack. Specifically, empirical findings suggest that most learners are unable to regulate their learning automatically. I thus argue that these activities consume working-memory resources as do activities that are closely related to schema construction. My article concludes with suggestions on how the concept of metacognitive load can be incorporated into resource-oriented theories such as the CLT to explain a wider variety of phenomena.},

The students of each age group were involved in an 18-h group-based activity after being randomly distributed in two conditions: "minimal" (with minimal MC and PS guidance) and "strong" (with strong MC and PS guidance). Evaluations were based on the Metacognitive Awareness Inventory measuring students' metacognitive awareness and on a think-aloud protocol asking students to describe the process they would follow to solve a certain robot-programming task. The results suggest that (a) strong guidance in solving problems can have a positive impact on students' MC and PS skills and (b) students reach eventually the same level of MC and PS skills development independently of their age and gender.},

A control group read the text with no embedded support. Groups were compared on measures of achievement, attitudes, cognitive load, and metacomprehension and calibration accuracy. Results indicated that a combination of embedded cognitive and metacognitive strategies in digital text improved learner achievement on application-level questions, yielded more accurate predictive calibration, and strengthened the relationship between metacomprehension and performance, all of which are common attributes of an academically successful learner.},

 abstract = {A central factor in research guided by the Cognitive Load Theory (CLT) is the mental effort people invest in performing a task. Mental effort is commonly assessed by asking people to report their effort throughout performing, learning, or problem-solving tasks. Although this measurement is considered reliable and valid in CLT research, metacognitive research provides robust evidence that self-appraisals of performance are often biased. In this review, we consider the possibility that mental effort appraisals may also be biased. In particular, we review signs for covariations and mismatches between subjective and objective measures of effort. Our review suggests that subjective and most objective effort measures appear reliable and valid when evaluated in isolation, because they discriminate among tasks of varying complexity. However, not much is known about their mutual correspondence—that is, whether subjective measures covariate with objective measures. Moreover, there is evidence that people utilize heuristic cues when appraising their effort, similar to utilization of heuristic cues underlying metacognitive appraisals of performance. These cues are identified by exposing biases—mismatch in effects of cue variations on appraisals and performance. The review concludes with a research agenda in which we suggest applying the well-established methodologies for studying biases in self-appraisals of performance in metacognitive research to investigating effort appraisals. One promising method could be to determine the covariation of effort appraisals and objective effort measures as an indicator of the resolution of effort appraisals.},

 abstract = {We report two studies involving an intelligent tutoring system for Lisp (the Carnegie Mellon University Lisp Tutor). In Experiment 1, we developed a model, based on production system theories of transfer and analogical problem solving, that accounts for effects of instructional examples, the transfer of cognitive skills across programming problems, and practice effects. In Experiment 2, we analyzed protocols collected from subjects as they processed instructional texts and examples before working with the Lisp Tutor and protocols collected after subjects solved each programming problem. The results suggest that the acquisition of cognitive skills is facilitated by high degrees of metacognition, which includes higher degrees of monitoring states of knowledge, more self-generated explanation goals and strategies, and greater attention to the instructional structure. Improvement in skill acquisition is also strongly related to the generation of explanations connecting the example material to the abstract terms introduced in the text, the generation of explanations that focus on the novel concepts, and spending more time in planning solutions to novel task components. We also found that self-explanation has diminishing returns. Finally, reflection on problem solutions that focus on understanding the abstractions underlying programs or that focus on understanding how programs work seems to be related to improved learning.},

 abstract = {Hypermedia learning environments (HLE) unevenly present new challenges and opportunities to learning processes and outcomes depending on learner characteristics and instructional supports. In this experimental study, we examined how one such HLE— MetaTutor, an intelligent, multi-agent tutoring system designed to scaffold cognitive and metacognitive self-regulated learning (SRL) processes—interacts with learner's prior domain knowledge to affect their note-taking activities and subsequent learning outcomes. Sixty (N = 60) college students studied with MetaTutor for 120 min and took notes on hypermedia content of the human circulatory system. Log-files and screen recordings of learner-system interactions were used to analyze notes for several quantitative and qualitative variables. Results show that most note-taking was a verbatim copy of instructional content, which negatively related to the post-test measure of learning. There was an interaction between prior knowledge and pedagogical agent scaffolding, such that low prior knowledge students took a greater quantity of notes compared to their high prior knowledge counterparts, but only in the absence of MetaTutor SRL scaffolding; when agent SRL scaffolding was present, the note-taking activities of low prior knowledge students were statistically equivalent to the number of notes taken by their high prior knowledge counterparts. Theoretical and instructional design implications are discussed.},

 abstract = {Intelligent tutoring systems have most frequently concentrated on imparting domain knowledge. However, there is another important aspect to learning. This is the meta level knowledge about how to learn a domain. Metacognition is a very important feature of learning. It consists of being aware of and regulating one's own cognitions. Good students have full control over their learning and see it as a planful and purposive activity. They reflect on their learning activities, are aware of a variety of strategies, and they oversee and monitor the application of these strategies, i.e. they are proficient in metacognitive activities. This paper describes a computer based system that helps students to learn these important self regulation skills. Students work with the system in pairs, and they can use it with any text from which they wish to learn. Apart from being used as a study aid, the system is being used as a tool to gather data about students' learning processes.},

 abstract = {Confidence judgements, self-assessments about the quality of a subject's knowledge, are considered a central example of metacognition. Prima facie, introspection and self-report appear the only way to access the subjective sense of confidence or uncertainty. Contrary to this notion, overt behavioural measures can be used to study confidence judgements by animals trained in decision-making tasks with perceptual or mnemonic uncertainty. Here, we suggest that a computational approach can clarify the issues involved in interpreting these tasks and provide a much needed springboard for advancing the scientific understanding of confidence. We first review relevant theories of probabilistic inference and decision-making. We then critically discuss behavioural tasks employed to measure confidence in animals and show how quantitative models can help to constrain the computational strategies underlying confidence-reporting behaviours. In our view, post-decision wagering tasks with continuous measures of confidence appear to offer the best available metrics of confidence. Since behavioural reports alone provide a limited window into mechanism, we argue that progress calls for measuring the neural representations and identifying the computations underlying confidence reports. We present a case study using such a computational approach to study the neural correlates of decision confidence in rats. This work shows that confidence assessments may be considered higher order, but can be generated using elementary neural computations that are available to a wide range of species. Finally, we discuss the relationship of confidence judgements to the wider behavioural uses of confidence and uncertainty.},

 abstract = {Many psychiatric disorders are characterized by problems with emotion regulation. Well-known therapeutic interventions include exclusively discursive therapies, like classical psychoanalysis, and exclusively noncognitive therapies, like psycho-pharmaceuticals. These forms of therapy are compatible with different theories of emotion: discursive therapy is a natural ally of cognitive theories, like Nussbaum’s (2009), according to which emotions are forms of judgment, while psycho-pharmacological intervention is a natural ally of noncognitive theories, like Prinz’s (2006), according to which emotions are forms of stimulus-dependent perception. I explore a third alternative: the therapeutic regulation of emotion as the development of metacognitive skills. This is a natural characterization of newer forms of therapy that are increasingly prescribed, like so-called Third-Wave Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and other mindfulness-inspired interventions. I argue that these newer forms of therapy make sense if we conceive of emotion as neither a form of judgment nor a form of perception, but, rather, as a variety of what Gendler calls “alief ” (2008). As Gendler notes, although aliefs do not succumb to direct rational regulation, they can be trained. Thus, if we conceive of emotions as aliefs, we can make sense of their therapeutic regulation through the development of metacognitive skills. Drawing on recent philosophical analyses of skill, as well as empirical paradigms in emotion regulation, and Buddhist characterizations of meditative practice, I sketch a characterization of metacognitive skill, and conclude with some reflections on the advantages of conceiving of psychotherapy as the development of metacognitive skills.},

 abstract = {This study analyzed discussion in an online conference that supplemented class discussion using an instructional method called the starter-wrapper technique within a traditional graduate level educational psychology course. Various quantitative measures were recorded to compare instructor and student participation rates. In addition, Henri's (1992) model for content analysis of computer-mediated communication was employed to qualitatively analyze the electronic discourse. Using this model, five key variables were examined: (1) student participation rates; (2) electronic interaction patterns; (3) social cues within student messages; (4) cognitive and metacognitive components of student messages; and (5) depth of processing — surface or deep — within message posting. Transcript content analyses showed that, while students tended to post just the one required comment per week in the conference, their messages were lengthy, cognitively deep, embedded with peer references, and indicative of a student oriented environment. Moreover, students were using high level cognitive skills such as inferencing and judgment as well as metacognitive strategies related to reflecting on experience and self-awareness. Weekly conference activity graphs revealed that student electronic comments became more interactive over time, but were highly dependent on the directions of discussion starter. To better understand the impact of electronic conferencing discourse, modifications to Henri's model as well as qualitative research suggestions were offered.},

 abstract = {Metacognition is usually construed as a conscious, intentional process whereby people reflect upon their own mental activity. Here, we instead suggest that metacognition is but an instance of a larger class of representational re-description processes that we assume occur unconsciously and automatically. From this perspective, the brain continuously and unconsciously learns to anticipate the consequences of action or activity on itself, on the world and on other people through three predictive loops: an inner loop, a perception—action loop and a self—other (social cognition) loop, which together form a tangled hierarchy. We ask what kinds of mechanisms may subtend this form of enactive metacognition. We extend previous neural network simulations and compare the model with signal detection theory, highlighting that while the latter approach assumes that both type I (objective) and type II (subjective, metacognition-based) decisions tap into the same signal at different hierarchical levels, our approach is closer to dual-route models in which it is assumed that the re-descriptions made possible by the emergence of meta-representations occur independently and outside of the first-order causal chain. We close by reviewing relevant neurological evidence for the idea that awareness, self-awareness and social cognition involve the same mechanisms.},

 abstract = {Research has shown a bi-directional association between the (perceived) amount of invested effort to learn or retrieve information (e.g., time, mental effort) and metacognitive monitoring judgments. The direction of this association likely depends on how learners allocate their effort. In self-paced learning, effort allocation is usually data driven, where the ease of memorizing is used as a cue, resulting in a negative correlation between effort and monitoring judgments. Effort allocation is goal driven when it is strategically invested (e.g., based on the importance of items or time pressure) and likely results in a positive correlation. The current study used a meta-analytic approach to synthesize the results from several studies on the relationship between effort and monitoring judgments. The results showed that there was a negative association between effort and monitoring judgments (r = – .355). Furthermore, an exploration of possible moderators of this association between effort and monitoring was made. The negative association was no longer significant when goal-driven regulation was manipulated Furthermore, it was found that the type of monitoring judgment (i.e., a weaker association for prospective judgments) and type of task (stronger association for problemsolving tasks relative to paired associates) moderated the relation between effort and monitoring. These results have important implications for future research on the use of effort as a cue for monitoring in self-regulated learning.},

 abstract = {An exponential increase in the availability of information over the last two decades has asked for novel theoretical frameworks to examine how students optimally learn under these new learning conditions, given the limitations of human processing ability. In this special issue and in the current editorial introduction, we argue that such a novel theoretical framework should integrate (aspects of) cognitive load theory and selfregulated learning theory. We describe the effort monitoring and regulation (EMR) framework, which outlines how monitoring and regulation of effort are neglected but essential aspects of self-regulated learning. Moreover, the EMR framework emphasizes the importance of optimizing cognitive load during self-regulated learning by reducing the unnecessary load on the primary task or distributing load optimally between the primary learning task and metacognitive aspects of the learning task. Three directions for future research that derive from the EMR framework and that are discussed in this editorial introduction are: (1) How do students monitor effort? (2) How do students regulate effort? and (3) How do we optimize cognitive load during self-regulated learning tasks (during and after the primary task)? Finally, the contributions to the current special issue are introduced.},

 abstract = {This study assessed the role different kinds of secondary tasks play for researching the modality effect of cognitive load theory. Ninety-six university students worked with a computer-based training program for approximately 13 min and had to fulfill an additional secondary task. In a 2 × 2 factorial design, modality of information presentation (within factor) and design of secondary task (between factor) were varied. Students of both experimental groups learned with visual-only and audiovisual information presentation. The secondary task consisted of monitoring an object either displayed spatially contiguous (monitoring the screen background color, N = 46) or spatially non-contiguous (monitoring a letter color in the upper part of the screen, N = 50). Reaction times on this secondary task were used to measure cognitive load. Results show that the modality effect only appears with the spatially non-contiguous task but not with the spatially contiguous task. We interpret this effect as due to only partial utilization of working memory capacity by the combination of primary task and spatially contiguous secondary task. The results highlight the importance of an appropriate secondary task design when investigating the modality effect but also not to overgeneralize multimedia design guidelines.},

 abstract = {Cognitive load can be induced by both learning tasks and self-regulated learning (SRL) activities, which compete for limited working memory capacity. However, there is little research on the relationship between cognitive load and SRL. This study explored how cognitive load interplayed with SRL behaviors and their joint effects on task performance (i.e., diagnostic efficiency) in the context of clinical reasoning. Specifically, twenty-seven (N = 27) medical students diagnosed three virtual patient cases in BioWorld, a simulation-based learning environment to improve medical students’ clinical reasoning skills. Students’ SRL behaviors were automatically recorded in BioWorld log files as they accomplished the tasks. We employed text mining techniques to extract four linguistic features from students’ concurrent think-aloud, i.e., cognitive discrepancy, insight, causation, and positive emotions, which were further used to represent students’ cognitive load. The latent profile analysis was then performed to cluster students into high- and low-load group. We also conducted a path analysis to investigate the mediation roles of SRL behaviors in the relationship between cognitive load and diagnostic efficiency (task performance). The results revealed that cognitive load negatively affected diagnostic efficiency, mediated by the ratio of SRL behaviors in the self-reflection phase. This study provides theoretical and methodological insights regarding the measurement of cognitive load and its interplay with SRL. This study informs the design of effective interventions for managing cognitive load in SRL within intelligent tutoring systems.},

 abstract = {This article is mainly devoted to the presentanoti of a particular technique of individual protocol coding, within a general framework of cognitive activity analysis in dynamic situations, as discussed in a related article (Amalberti & Hoc, 1998). This presentation should enable the reader to use the technique. This article evokes the main features of the general framework, and then fully descubes a particular coding scheme. The second section presents the type of situation referred to (partly controlled by the human operator), the cognitive architecture related to it, and some examples that will be used as illustrations in the third section which presents the coding scheme. This scheme makes use of the predicate-arguments formalism. Predicates code elementary cognitive acnvities. Arguments express mental representations and more specific features of acnvities. Three classes of individual acnvities are considered : information elaboration (before the interpretative processes), diagnosis (mainly interpretation and inference), and decision-making (including decision assessment). A third class is added to describe cooperative activities, and some metastrategic activities are considered. This third section is illustrated by several examples showing the type of results which were obtained from the application of the coding scheme. The fourth section of the article is devoted to important questions raised during the successive steps of the analysis : protocol encoding (compromise between the general value of the results and the domain specificity ; compromise between the ease of encoding and the needs of the data analysis ; the link between the grain of the analysis, the aims and the means of the study ; the encoding focus and reproducibüity), the data analysis (elicitation of some properties of a cognitive model), and the conclusions (description, explanation, interpretation, theoretical and practical benefits).

Le cadre général est brièvement rappelé et l'essentiel de l'article porte sur la technique qui s'inspire du formalisme prédicat-arguments. On code des activités cognitives d'élaboration de l'information, de diagnostic et de prise de décision, des activités coopératives et des activités métastratégiques. Quelques questions importantes qui se posent au moment de l'encodage, de l'analyse des données et de la formulation des conclusions sont abordées, ainsi que des questions plus générales relevant de la description, de l'explication, de l'interprétation et des bénéfices théoriques et pratiques de cette approche.},

 abstract = {The mystery surrounding consciousness as subjectivity dissipates dramatically when understood in its biological context. The core characteristics of consciousness can be seen to derive from its functionality, and the fundamental function of cognition, given the equivalence of mental activity and brain process, is to advance the survival and thus the self-regulative capacity of the organism of which the brain is a part. These core elements of consciousness are comprised of a self-locational data structure which serves to configure ongoing experience in terms of controllable spatial and temporal parameters, and a processing regime for this orientational schema which has evolved from the feedback architecture necessary for regulating behavior in relation to homeostatic needs. These two self-regulative constituents yield a primitive form of consciousness as subjectivity — simple reflexive awareness — which provides the basis for the subsequent development of metacognitive mechanisms which monitor and control the cognitive processes which regulate behavior in relation to metabolic requirements.},

 abstract = {Cognition is not, and could not possibly be, entirely representational in character. There is also a phenomenal form of cognitive expression that registers the intrinsic properties of mental states themselves. Arguments against the reality of this intrinsic phenomenal dimension to mental experience have focused either on its supposed impossibility (since the brain possesses no such properties), or secondly, the non-appearance of any such qualities to introspection. This paper argues to the contrary, that the registration of cognitive state properties does take place independently of representational content; and necessarily so, since it supports an independent function—self-management. Given the fact that unlike a computer, the brain must, of necessity, operate itself, it needs to be in touch with itself to do so. Intrinsic phenomenal forms of cognitive expression allow the brain to do just that by registering characteristics of the cognitive states themselves. Self-management might well prove to constitute the prime reason for the emergence of subjectivity itself.},

 abstract = {How should one attribute epistemic credit to an agent, and hence, knowledge, when cognitive processes include an extensive use of human or mechanical enhancers, informational tools, and devices which allow one to complement or modify one’s own cognitive system? The concept of integration of a cognitive system has been used to address this question. For true belief to be creditable to a person’s ability, it is claimed, the relevant informational processes must be or become part of the cognitive character of the agent, as a result of a process of enculturation. We argue that this view does not capture the role of sensitivity to epistemic norms in forming true beliefs. An analysis of epistemic actions, basic and extended, is proposed as offering an appropriate framework for crediting an agent with knowledge.},

The thoroughness of generative content and quality of self-explanations significantly predicted test performance. In regards to cognitive load, participants who predicted and self-explained reported significantly higher levels of mental effort, decreased levels of confidence, and higher levels of frustration compared to those in other treatments.

 abstract = {In the study, the authors addressed two areas of inquiry: the influence of enlisting three underlying cognitive learning processes in alphabet learning, and order effects for letter name and letter sound instruction. Alphabet instruction was designed to enlist paired-associate learning (PAL) only, PAL plus orthographic learning, or PAL plus articulatory learning. Subjects were 94 preschool children, including 35 dual-language learners, in eight public preschool classrooms with low-income eligibility thresholds. Children were randomly assigned within each classroom to small groups that were randomly assigned to one of the three treatments and to one of two orders in which letter names and letter sounds were taught. Research assistants provided 10 weeks of instruction for 12–15 minutes per day, four days a week. All children in the three treatments made significant growth from pretest to posttest on all measures of alphabet learning. Children in the PAL-only condition had significantly higher gains than the sample average on four of the five alphabet measures. Post hoc tests showed that PAL only significantly outperformed the other two conditions on four of the five measures but only for native English-speaking children. No evidence of differences among treatments was found for dual-language learners. Additionally, there was no main effect for order of letter name or letter sound instruction, although teaching letter sounds before letter names was statistically significantly better in the PAL-only treatment. Findings support explicit alphabet instruction emphasizing the relation between verbal letter labels and letter forms that enlists PAL processes.},

The findings indicated that computer games, compared with paper-and-pencil drills, were significantly more effective in promoting learning motivation but not significantly different in facilitating cognitive math test performance and metacognitive awareness. Additionally, this study established that alternative classroom goal structures mediated the effects of computer games on mathematical learning outcomes.

The acquisition of moral agency in business involves the recognition, refinement, and habituation through the processes of reflexion and reflection of a moral sense encapsulated in innate modules for compassion, hierarchy, reciprocity, purity, and affiliation adaptive for communal life both in ancestral and modern environments. The genetic and neural bases of morality exist independently of institutional frameworks and social structures. The latter not only shape moral behaviors within circumscribed limits, they also imply a plurality and compartmentalization of roles which may enable or impede the habituation of virtue. Becoming a virtuous agent entails the practical refinement of predispositions in situ as a member of a community of practitioners rather than entailing a normative ethical educational project seeking an intellectual resolution of abstract moral questions.},

Due to the features of the task environment, one of the main problems caused by the medium is information overload (IO). Yet the literature is unclear about the impact of IO on student learning. This study therefore investigated the influence of online students' perceived IO on their participation and knowledge construction in terms of cognitive and metacognitive processing as observed in online discussions via CMC. Interviews with students and computer conferencing transcripts were analyzed both qualitatively and quantitatively. The results indicated that students' perceived IO might influence their participation and levels of cognitive processing in online discussions. However, the results suggest that IO did not affect every student because some seemed to have learned how to manage IO. The results further suggest the critical role of learners' metacognitive competence regarding internal management of cognitive load.},

 abstract = {ABSTRACT An increasing part of cognitive load research in technology-based learning includes a component of repeated measurements, that is: participants are measured two or more times on the same performance, mental effort or other variable of interest. In many cases, researchers aggregate scores obtained from repeated measurements to one single sum or average score per participant and use these aggregated scores in subsequent analysis. This paper demonstrates some dangers of this commonly encountered aggregation approach and presents two comprehensive alternatives: Split-plot analysis of variance (ANOVA) and more flexible two-level regression analysis. The core message of this paper is that the application of the aggregation approach can seriously distort our view of effects and relations of interest and should therefore not be used in cognitive load research. Multilevel analysis of repeated measurements data can account for various features of the data and constitutes a best practice.},

In accordance with the definition of model-based learning as an acquisition and utilization of mental models by learners, the first section centers on mental model theory. In accordance with epistemology of modeling the issues of semantics, ontology, and learning with models as well as structural aspects and functions of mental models (such as simplification, idealization, analogy, simulation) will be discussed. Starting with early theoretical approaches in the realm of cognitive science, the emphasis will be on recent theoretical developments in the field of reinforcement learning that distinguish between model-based and model-free learning. These new theoretical approaches confirm, to a large extent, the early theories of mental models but they also contribute new insights in age-related aspects of model-based learning. The second main section of the article provides a review of basic and applied research on model-based learning. A short overview of basic research on mental models aims at sketching an "overall picture" followed by a more detailed description and discussion of findings in the field of instructional research, especially with regard to K-12 STEM education and the support of model-based learning through teaching and technology.},

 abstract = {This article presents two longitudinal studies that investigated expertise reversal effects in journal writing. In Experiment 1, students wrote regular journal entries over a whole term. The experimental group received a combination of cognitive and metacognitive prompts. The control group received no prompts. In the first half of the term, the experimental group applied more cognitive and metacognitive strategies in their journals and showed higher learning outcomes than the control group. Towards the end of the term, the amount of cognitive and metacognitive strategies elicited by the experimental group decreased while the number of cognitive strategies applied by the control group increased. Accordingly, the experimental group lost its superiority on learning outcomes. In order to avoid these negative long-term effects of prompts, a gradual and adaptive fading-out of the prompts was introduced in the experimental group in Experiment 2 while a control group received permanent prompts. The results showed that, over the course of the term, the fading group applied increasingly more cognitive strategies while the control group applied fewer and fewer cognitive strategies. Accordingly, at the end of the term, the permanent prompts group showed substantially lower learning outcomes than the fading group. Together, these results provide evidence for an expertise reversal effect in writing-to-learn. The more the students became skilled in journal writing and internalized the desired strategies, the more the external guidance by prompts became a redundant stimulus that interfered with the students' internal tendency to apply the strategies and, thus, induced extraneous cognitive load. Accordingly, a gradual fading-out of the prompts in line with the learners' growing competencies proved to be effective in mitigating the negative side-effects of the provided instructional support.},

Yet, forgetting does not have exclusively negative consequences; it also serves valuable, indeed vital, functions. In this article, I review and reflect on evidence from various areas of research, and I argue that forgetting serves at least three broad purposes. First, it is part of emotion regulation, and it promotes subjective well-being by limiting access to negative memories and by reducing unpleasant affect. Forgetting thereby allows for positivity and painlessness. Second, it is involved in knowledge acquisition, and it provides a basis for obtaining semantic and procedural knowledge by allowing for abstraction and automatization. Third, forgetting is part of context attunement, and it orients information processing for the present and the future by facilitating environmental sensitivity and by ensuring that knowledge is current, which enables timeliness and updating. Overall, I suggest that forgetting helps people to be happy, well-structured, and context sensitive, and thereby that it serves fundamentally adaptive functions.},

Research has identified that students' self-regulatory learning (SRL) processes may mediate the hypothesized positive relations between CBLEs and academic performance. In this review, we identified 33 empirical studies of SRL and CBLEs. We address three research questions: (1) How do learner and task characteristics relate to students' SRL with CBLEs? (2) Can various learning supports or conditions enhance the quality of students' SRL as they learn with CBLEs? (3) What conceptual, theoretical, and methodological issues exist for this growing area of research? We found evidence that specific SRL processes are more often associated with academic success than others and that SRL skills can be supported. We also identified a number of issues that researchers should aim to address in future investigations, including a more comprehensive measurement of facets of SRL and the quality of SRL processes, the seeming disconnect between SRL processes and learning outcomes, and the distinction between self- and other-regulation.},

Theoreticians agree that SRL is predictive of improved academic outcomes and motivation because students acquire the adaptive and autonomous learning characteristics required for an enhanced engagement with the learning process and subsequent successful performance. The theory of formative assessment is found to be a unifying theory of instruction, which guides practice and improves the learning process by developing SRL strategies among learners. In a postmodern era characterized by rapid technical and scientific advance and obsolescence, there is a growing emphasis on the acquisition of learning strategies which people may rely on across the entire span of their life. Research consistently finds that the self-regulation of cognitive and affective states supports the drive for lifelong learning by: enhancing the motivational disposition to learn, enriching reasoning, refining meta-cognitive skills, and improving performance outcomes. The specific purposes of the article are to provide practitioners, administrators and policy-makers with: (a) an account of the very extensive conceptual territory that is the 'theory of formative assessment' and (b) how the goals of formative feedback operate to reveal recondite learning processes, thereby reinforcing SRL strategies which support learning, improve outcomes and actualize the drive for lifelong learning.},

 abstract = {This study used a sequential set-up to investigate the consecutive effects of timing of supportive information presentation (information before vs. information during the learning task clusters) in interactive digital learning materials (IDLMs) and type of collaboration (personal discussion vs. online discussion) in computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) on student knowledge construction. Students (N = 87) were first randomly assigned to the two information presentation conditions to work individually on a case-based assignment in IDLM. Students who received information during learning task clusters tended to show better results on knowledge construction than those who received information only before each cluster. The students within the two separate information presentation conditions were then randomly assigned to pairs to discuss the outcomes of their assignments under either the personal discussion or online discussion condition in CSCL. When supportive information had been presented before each learning task cluster, online discussion led to better results than personal discussion. When supportive information had been presented during the learning task clusters, however, the online and personal discussion conditions had no differential effect on knowledge construction. Online discussion in CSCL appeared to compensate for suboptimal timing of presentation of supportive information before the learning task clusters in IDLM.},

However, these studies did not focus on the specific aspects of peer response that made it effective. The present review analyzes the effects of instructional factors accompanying peer response in 26 studies on writing proficiency. Three theoretical perspectives are distinguished: a cognitive, a social-cognitive, and a genre perspective underlying the reviewed studies. In all studies, additional instruction in strategies, rules for interaction, genre knowledge, or a combination of these instructional aspects to writing with peer response is provided. Peer response with such additional instruction seems effective compared with individual writing. Recommendations for future investigations are directed to methodological issues for comparing the effects of separate instructional components for writing with peer response. In addition, it is advised to direct future studies towards more controlled research into the effects of instruction in genre knowledge on writing with peer response.},

 abstract = {In this review we argue that interactivity can be effective in video-based models to engage learners in relevant cognitive processes. We do not treat modeling as an isolated instructional method but adopted the social cognitive model of sequential skill acquisition in which learners start with observation and finish with independent, self-regulated performance. Moreover, we concur with the notion that interactivity should emphasize the cognitive processes that learners engage in when they interact with the learning environment. The four-component instructional design (4C/ID) model is used to define a set of cognitive processes: Elaboration and induction enable learners to construct schemas, whereas compilation and strengthening enable learners to automate these schemas. Pacing, cues, control over appearance, prediction, working in dyads, personalized task selection, and reflection prompts are identified as guidelines that might support learners to interactively construct schemas. Personalized task selection with part-task practice helps learners to interactively automate schemas.},

 abstract = {We propose the self-regulation view in writing-to-learn as a promising theoretical perspective that draws on models of self-regulated learning theory and cognitive load theory. According to this theoretical perspective, writing has the potential to scaffold selfregulated learning due to the cognitive offloading written text generally offers as an external representation and memory aid, and due to the offloading, that specifically results from the genre-free principle in journal writing. However, to enable learners to optimally exploit this learning opportunity, the journal writing needs to be instructionally supported. Accordingly, we have set up a research program—the Freiburg Self-Regulated-Journal-Writing Approach—in which we developed and tested different instructional support methods to foster learning outcomes by optimizing cognitive load during self-regulated learning by journal writing. We will highlight the main insights of our research program which are synthesized from 16 experimental and 4 correlative studies published in 16 original papers. Accordingly, we present results on (1) the effects of prompting germane processing in journal writing, (2) the effects of providing worked examples and metacognitive information to support students in effectively exploiting prompted journal writing for self-regulated learning, (3) the effects of adapting and fading guidance in line with learners’expertise in self-regulated learning, and (4) the effects of journal writing on learning motivation and motivation to write. The article closes with a discussion of several avenues of how the Freiburg Self-Regulated-Journal-Writing Approach can be developed further to advance research that integrates self-regulated learning with cognitive load theory.},

 abstract = {Student-centered learning (SCL) identifies students as the owners of their learning. While SCL is increasingly discussed in K-12 and higher education, researchers and practitioners lack current and comprehensive framework to design, develop, and implement SCL. We examine the implications of theory and research-based evidence to inform those who seek clear guidelines to support students' engagement and autonomous learning. SCL is rooted in constructivist and constructionist as well as self-determination theories. Constructs of these theories have been studied respectively; however, the intersections among the three theories require further exploration. First, we identify autonomy, scaffolding, and audience as key constructs of SCL engagement. Then, we propose a design framework that encompasses motivational, cognitive, social, and affective aspects of learning: Own it, Learn it, and Share it. It is recommended that students: (a) develop ownership over the process and achieve personally meaningful learning goals; (b) learn autonomously through metacognitive, procedural, conceptual, and strategic scaffolding; and (c) generate artifacts aimed at authentic audiences beyond the classroom assessment. Furthermore, we suggest ten design guidelines under the framework and conclude with questions for future research.},

 abstract = {Recent research in a text-based educational context has demonstrated a seemingly paradoxical disfluency effect in reading, namely that learning with hard-to-read (disfluent) materials helps learners recall more details than learning with easy-to-read (fluent) materials. Many follow-up studies using a variety of participants, learning materials, and experimental designs have been conducted to verify the effects of disfluency manipulation on recall, transfer, judgments of learning, and learning time. However, a number of them have failed to replicate this effect and the mixed findings bring into question the generality of the disfluency effect with respect to learning. In this meta-analysis, we tested the overall effect of perceptual disfluency on learning with texts, as well as moderators of this effect, based on 25 empirical articles involving 3135 participants. Results showed that overall, there was no effect of perceptual disfluency on recall (d=-0.01) or transfer (d=0.03), but perceptual disfluency did reduce participants' judgments of learning (d=-0.43) and increase learning time (d=0.52). Tests of moderation focused on the most commonly studied dependent measure, namely recall. There was no evidence that characteristics of the participants, learning material, or experimental design moderated the effect of perceptual disfluency on recall. In general, though perceptual disfluency can be used as an effective metacognitive cue to reduce judgments of learning and increase learning time, there is not enough evidence to show that it either stimulates analytic processing or increases extraneous cognitive load.},

 abstract = {Contrary to system-controlled multimedia learning environments, hypermedia systems are characterized by a high level of interactivity. This interactivity is referred to as learner control in the respective literature. For several reasons this learner control is seen as a major advantage of hypermedia for learning and instruction. For instance, learner control might increase students' interest and motivation, facilitate adaptive instruction, or provide affordances for active and constructive information processing. In this paper we analyze the instructional potentials of learner-controlled hypermedia environments as well as possible reasons for the ambiguous results of studies that have aimed at determining the effectiveness of hypermedia learning. According to our analysis, the potential effectiveness of self-controlled learning with hypermedia might be difficult to demonstrate due to (1) usability problems (i.e., disorientation, distraction, cognitive overload), (2) moderating learner characteristics (i.e., prior knowledge, self-regulatory skills, cognitive styles, and attitudes towards learning), (3) a lack of conceptual foundations, and (4) methodological shortcomings of many hypermedia studies. The findings reviewed in this paper and the corresponding claim that hypermedia may be effective only if used in a sensible way are used to derive a couple of guidelines for further research on hypermedia learning.},

 abstract = {Building bridges between two of the most influential research fields in educational psychology, self-regulation and cognitive load theory, is highly relevant but also challenging. The collection of papers in this special issue reflects this interplay by reviewing the stills carce base of empirical data in an impressively elaborated and profound way. The papers offer different perspectives on how to improve learning by stimulating both activities for self-regulation as well as for reflecting the mental effort which can be used in return for monitoring and regulation. They provide arguments for the two sidedness of the relationship of self-regulation and cognitive load: that cognitive load can cause self-regulation and that self-regulation can cause cognitive load. The common understanding of self-regulation in this issue is very much focused on monitoring and could benefit from a broader view by including the whole cycle of self-regulation and moderating motivational factors like self-efficacy, as proposed in many self-regulation models. The conceptualization of effort, as it is referred to in most of the papers, could also profit from a more differentiated view, which takes into account the origin of required or invested mental effort. Overall, what learners actually decide to do when dealing with self-regulation as well as with cognitive load highly depends on their resources. In an integrative model, the role of potential resources is discussed as a starting point for future research. This discussion invites for an even broader, more individualized, and differentiated view to add to the bridge-building attempts of this impressive collection of research.},

 abstract = {The main goals of this paper are to exemplify and further elaborate on the theoretical connections between cognitive load and self-regulated learning. In an effort to achieve this, we integrate the concepts of self-control and self-management within the effort monitoring and regulation (EMR) framework laid out by de Bruin et al. (Educational Psychology Review this issue). More specifically, we argue that (1) cognitive load results from how the instruction is processed and not just from how it is designed (cf. selfmanagement effect). (2) How instruction is processed by students (also) depends on their skill and will to self-control. For instance, high self-control may reflect compensatory processing of poorer instructional designs so that these designs may not lead to higher extraneous cognitive load. As soon as students’ willingness to self-control declines (e.g., with increasing study durations or previous demanding tasks), there is a closer link between (poorer) instructional designs and (higher) extraneous cognitive load in selfregulated learning tasks. Combining (1) and (2), we consider cognitive load to be influenced by self-control; (self-) control, in turn, is one central process of the monitoring-control cycle that characterizes self-regulated learning. We support these theoretical arguments by referring to empirical research in the domain of learning with multiple representations—with a particular focus on learning with and without seductive details during extended study episodes. We conclude with suggestions for further research.},

 abstract = {Retrieval practice has been widely studied as an effective strategy for enhancing memory. In this review article, we discuss how its effects on learning complex problem-solving procedures are less straightforward, however, with repeated studying of worked examples sometimes more effective than problem-solving practice. This worked example benefit has been interpreted within the framework of cognitive load theory. In both memorybased tasks and problem-solving tasks, students rate retrieval as more effortful, and less effective for learning, than repeated study. Self-regulated learning decisions do not align with the evidence about the effectiveness of retrieval, as students often avoid using retrieval in memory-based tasks but frequently use it in more complex problem-solving tasks. Patterns associated with self-report survey data and self-regulated learning decisions suggest that retrieval may be used primarily as a means of checking knowledge, and the effort experienced during retrieval may drive subsequent study decisions (i.e., the choice to engage in retrieval vs. further study) to the extent that the experienced effort is interpreted as a sign that learning has been ineffective. We discuss implications of students’ views about the purpose of retrieval for effective monitoring and regulation of effort during learning, and propose interventions that may improve students’ optimal use of retrieval in their study decisions.},

 abstract = {Preschoolers' ability to introspect and make decisions on the basis of these introspections has traditionally been questioned. The present research introduces a novel paradigm to examine the development of the connection between subjective uncertainty about memory and decision making in preschoolers. Three-, 4-, and 5-year-olds (N = 81) encoded items presented once or twice. They then completed a forced-choice test, provided confidence judgments for each response, and decided whether to select or exclude answers to be evaluated for the possibility of reward. Four- and 5-year-olds, but not 3-year-olds, reported lower certainty for incorrect and weaker memories than for correct and stronger memories, and they judiciously excluded their least confident memories, which resulted in accuracy gains for selected memories; these findings highlight age-related improvements in introspection on memory accuracy. Among accurate responses only, even 3-year-olds excluded their least confident answers, which suggests that the connection between uncertainty and decision making precedes the ability to monitor memory accuracy.},

 abstract = {This "Monograph" aims to contribute to the information processing, the differential, and the developmental modeling of the mind, and to work these into an integrated theory. Toward this aim, a longitudinal study is presented that investigates the relations between processing efficiency, working memory, and problem solving from the age of 8 years to to the age of 16 years. The study involved 113 participants, about equally drawn among 8-, 10-, 12-, and 14-year-olds at the first testing; these participants were tested two more times spaced one year apart. Participants were tested with a large array of tasks addressed to processing efficiency (i.e., speed of processing and inhibition), working memory (in terms of Baddeley's model, phonological storage, visual storage, and the central executive of working memory), and problem solving (quantitative, spatial, and verbal reasoning). Confirmatory factor analysis validated the presence of each of the above dimensions and indicated that they are organized in a three-stratum hierarchy. The first stratum includes all of the individual dimensions mentioned above. These dimensions are organized, at the second stratum, in three constructs: processing efficiency, working memory, and problem solving. Finally, all second-order constructs are strongly related to a third-order general factor. This structure was stable in time. Structural equation modeling indicated that the various dimensions are interrelated in a cascade fashion so that more fundamental dimensions are part of more complex dimensions. That is, speed of processing is the most important aspect of processing efficiency, and it perfectly relates to the condition of inhibition, indicating that the more efficient one is in stimulus encoding and identification, the more efficient one is in inhibition. In turn, processing efficiency is strongly related to the condition of executive processes in working memory, which, in turn, is related to the condition of the two modality-specific stores (phonological and visual). Finally, problem solving is related to processing efficiency and working memory, the central executive in particular. All dimensions appear to change systematically with time. Growth modeling suggested that there are significant individual differences in attainment in each of the three aspects of the mind investigated. Moreover, each of the three aspects of the mind as well as their interrelations change differently during development. Mixture growth modeling suggested that there are four types of developing persons, each defined by a different combination of performance in these aspects of the mind. Some types are more efficient and stable developers than others. These analyses indicated that processing efficiency is a factor closely associated with developmental differences in problem solving, whereas working memory is associated with individual differences. Modeling by logistic equations uncovered the rates and form of change in the various dimensions and their reciprocal interactions during development. These findings are discussed from the point of view of information processing, differential, and developmental models of thinking, and an integrative model is proposed.},

This paper reports an experimental study with 98 participants where effective instructional interventions for self-regulated learning within problem-solving processes are investigated. Furthermore, an automated assessment and analysis methodology for determining the quality of learning outcomes is introduced.

It is argued that behavioral theory is inadequate to prescribe instructional strategies that teach for understanding. Examples of how instructional designers have adopted relevant aspects of cognitive theory are described. However, it is argued that such adoption is only a first step. The growing body of evidence for the indeterminism of human cognition requires even further changes in how instructional designers think and act. A number of bodies of scholarly research and opinion are cited in support of this claim. Three implications of cognitive theory for design are offered: instructional strategies need to be developed to counter the reductionism implicit in task analysis; design needs to be integrated into the implementation of instruction; designers should work from a thorough knowledge of theory not just from design procedures.},

 abstract = {Learners employ a wide variety of strategies when faced with learning and problem solving in a new domain. The focus of this research is on learners' strategies when studying and explaining instructional materials to themselves prior to problem solving. In the first part of the article, we present results from an empirical study in which the learning and self-explanation strategies of subjects studying instructions embedded in a hypertext environment were contrasted with those from subjects learning with more standard, linear instruction. In the hypertext environment, instruction could be browsed in a nonlinear fashion, and the instructional examples were annotated with explanatory elaborations that students could choose to view. We present a Soar computational model that accounts for results from the study. A particular emphasis of the model was on capturing strategy differences between individual subjects. The general modeling approach involved coupling a model of individual subjects' interaction strategies with opportunities for action supported by the interfaces of the instructional environments. Specifically, by setting parameters, the model was fit to individual subject data. Analyses of subjects' simulations contribute several new results for understanding individual differences in strategy use and their role in learning. We show that clusters of subjects identified through analyses of model parameters continued to exhibit similar behaviors during subsequent problem solving, suggesting that the clusters corresponded to genuine strategy classes. Furthermore, these clusters appeared to represent general strategies that were, in some sense, adaptive to the task.},

 abstract = {The aims of this three-year longitudinal study were to examine 1) the concurrent development of different components of the self-system; 2) how the development of this self-system relates to cognitive and metacognitive development in reading; and 3) whether or not there are gender differences both in the development of the self-system as well as in its relation to the development of reading. One hundred and seventy-eight elementary school children were first assessed in the fourth grade and then again in each of the two following years. A similar pattern of intercorrelations between self-system components was evident for boys and girls, and this pattern was quite stable across the three school grades. In addition, similar patterns of moderate relations between the self-system and cognitive and metacognitive development in reading were observed across time. According to these findings, there appears to be some stability, consistency and coherence in how late elementary school children's beliefs about themselves as learners are organized in their self-system. It is also evident that children of this age are able to make valid self-appraisals of their capabilities. Les buts de cette étude longitudinale conduite pendant trois ans étaient d'examiner: 1) le développement conjoint de différentes facettes du système du soi; 2) dans quelle mesure le développement de ce système est en relation avec le développement d'aspects cognitifs et métacognitifs de la lecture; 3) dans quelle mesure le développement de ces relations est différent chez les garçons et chez les filles. Cent soixante-dix-huit enfants de l'école élémentaire ont été examinés en 4ème année (10 ans) et au cours des deux années suivantes. Une même structure corrélationnelle entre composantes du soi a été trouvée pour les enfants des deux sexes, cette structure restant stable durant les trois années considérées. Les relations entre les composantes du système de soi et le développement des aspects cognitifs et métacognitifs de l'acquisition de la lecture se sont avérées plutôt faibles aux trois étapes de l'étude longitudinale. Les données indiquent la stabilité et la cohérence des croyances que les enfants ont de leurs caractéristiques en tant qu'apprenants à la fin de la scolarité élémentaire. Il est clair enfin que les enfants de cet âge sont capables d'évaluations valides de leurs propres capacités.},

 abstract = {This article presents a conceptual analysis of collaboration scripts used in face-to-face and computer-mediated collaborative learning. Collaboration scripts are scaffolds that aim to improve collaboration through structuring the interactive processes between two or more learning partners. Collaboration scripts consist of at least five components: (a) learning objectives, (b) type of activities, (c) sequencing, (d) role distribution, and (e) type of representation. These components serve as a basis for comparing prototypical collaboration script approaches for face-to-face vs. computer-mediated learning. As our analysis reveals, collaboration scripts for face-to-face learning often focus on supporting collaborators in engaging in activities that are specifically related to individual knowledge acquisition. Scripts for computer-mediated collaboration are typically concerned with facilitating communicative-coordinative processes that occur among group members. The two lines of research can be consolidated to facilitate the design of collaboration scripts, which both support participation and coordination, as well as induce learning activities closely related to individual knowledge acquisition and metacognition. In addition, research on collaboration scripts needs to consider the learners' internal collaboration scripts as a further determinant of collaboration behavior. The article closes with the presentation of a conceptual framework on script-based learning that incorporates both external and internal collaboration scripts.},

 abstract = {Reading texts with instructional pictures (text-picture integration) is a key component of students’ learning processes in most school subjects, and teachers are tasked with helping their students acquire and refine this skill. The present study focuses on how teachers support their students with this process, and if this support contributes to improved text-picture reading skills. Analyzing self-reports of 56 science and German teachers at secondary schools, we found that the self-reported frequency of using text-picture reading material and the explicit discussion of the instructional picture affected students’ skill improvement positively in the science, but not in the German classes. The self-reported teachers’ efforts to guarantee all students’ understanding of the pictures had no significant effect on students’ skill improvement, however. A Matthew effect for students with higher prior text-picture reading skills was observed. The findings suggest that more research on teachers’ instructional strategies in this important area of daily school activity in most subjects is needed to further understand how the impact of teachers on students’ learning can be improved. Possible research directions are discussed.},

A large body of research indicates that effective regulation of learning is beneficial for achievement. Set against this research are findings showing that the promotion by teachers of strategies for the self-regulation of learning (SRL), and student use of these strategies, is less common than might be expected. We review this research on the promotion and use of SRL strategies and suggest that a range of beliefs about learning and SRL strategies limit the promotion of SRL learning strategies by teachers. This contributes in turn to the lack of knowledge and use of such strategies by students. These beliefs are represented as forming an interrelated system that needs to be made explicit and examined in order to increase the level of SRL strategy promotion and use. Each of the beliefs is described and the paper concludes with discussion of the implications of the review for teacher educators, teachers, students, school leaders, curriculum designers and researchers.},

 abstract = {Most people will grant that we bear special moral obligations toward at least some nonhuman animals that we do not bear toward inanimate objects like stones, mountains, or works of art (however priceless). These moral obligations are plausibly grounded in the fact that many if not all nonhuman animals share important psychological states and capacities with us, such as consciousness, suffering, and goal-directed behavior. But which of these states and capacities are really critical for a creature’s possessing moral status, and how can we determine which animals do in fact have them? In this paper, I examine three main approaches to answering these questions. First are what I term consciousness-based approaches that tackles these questions by first asking which animals are conscious. Second are affective-state approaches that focus on identifying behavioural and physiological signatures of states like pain, fear, and stress. Finally, I consider what I call preference-based approaches whose focus is on the question of which organisms have robust motivational states. I examine the prospects and challenges—both theoretical and empirical—faced by these seemingly contrasting methodologies. I go on to suggest that there are reasons why, despite challenges, we should be robustly committed to the project of identifying psychological grounds of moral status. I conclude by suggesting we should also take seriously the idea of pluralism about moral status, according to which each of these approaches might be capable of providing independent grounds for moral consideration.},

 abstract = {The self-prompting theory of consciousness holds that conscious perceptual experience occurs when non-routine perceptual data prompt the activation of a plan in an executive control system that monitors perceptual input. On the other hand, routine, nonconscious perception merely provides data about the world, which indicatively describes the world correctly or incorrectly. Perceptual experience instead involves data that are about the perceiver, not the world. Their function is that of imperatively prompting the perceiver herself to do something (hence "self-prompting") via the monitoring activities of her executive control system. The theory explains both phenomenal consciousness and "what it is like" to be perceptually conscious of an item. In addition, as applied to early perceptual attention, the self-prompting theory can explain how and why consciousness evolved.},

 abstract = {Recent research has shown that reducing the perceptual fluency of shape processing can be an effective means for overcoming the interference of the More A-More B intuitive rule among grade 3 students in a perimeter comparison task. From the perspective of cognitive load, the current study focused on the mechanism of perceptual fluency on overcoming the interference of the More A-More B intuitive rule among grade 3 students in a perimeter comparison task. The existing studies have suggested that perceptual disfluency will inevitably increase ECL in the task-solving process and thus potentially detrimental toward learning. However, we could argue that overcoming the interference of the More A-More B intuitive rule in the disfluent condition could be interpreted as a simultaneous increase in cognitive GCL. Because of the theoretically complementary relationship between ECL and GCL, two experiments were designed to respectively examine ECL and GCL under different perceptual fluency conditions in the perimeter comparison task. Experiment 1 (N = 33) used a dual-task paradigm to examine participants’ ECL, manipulating the clarity of shapes. The results indicated that participants experienced significantly less interference from the More A-More B intuitive rule under the low-perceptual-fluency condition than under the high-perceptual-fluency condition, while ECL was significantly higher under the former condition than under the latter one. Experiment 2 (N = 72) explored GCL in the perimeter comparison task through a self-designed transfer test, using an identical manipulation method of perceptual fluency as in experiment 1. Compared to the high-perceptual-fluency group, participants in the low-perceptual-fluency group performed significantly better in the perimeter comparison task and transfer test. It was concluded that low perceptual fluency resulted in participants’ ECL while at the same time producing GCL during completion of the perimeter comparison task.},

 abstract = {The present study investigated the effects on students' learning experience of adding a video of a teacher to an e-learning module. A total of 43 undergraduates were asked to learn the content of a pedagogical document either with or without a teacher video on the screen. Although video captures of teachers are increasingly being integrated into online courses, few studies have investigated their impact and the best way of optimizing them. According to the social-cue hypothesis, the presence of a teacher (face and gestures) positively influences learners' motivation and engagement in their learning. By contrast, the interference hypothesis holds that the teacher's presence can lead to poor performances, as it acts as a source of visual interference that diverts students' attention away from the relevant information. By assessing subjective ratings and learning outcomes, the present study tended to support the social-cue hypothesis, as it showed that adding a teacher video on screen significantly improved students' retention of the spoken explanations, without disturbing either their performances on diagram and transfer problems or the time needed to process the document. Eye-tracking data showed that students spent 25% of their time watching the teacher video. Adding this video had no significant observable effects on the subjective ratings (i.e., social presence, evaluation of the teacher's motivational skills, situational interest, cognitive load). These results suggest that videos of teachers can be used to improve social cues in multimedia learning without creating interference effects.},

This phenomenon is called the disfluency effect and is attributed to a subjective feeling of task difficulty resulting in a deeper learning approach. In two studies (n₁ = 67, n₂ = 73) we investigated the impact of three increasing disfluency levels compared to a fluent condition on learning outcomes, in the second study we additionally addressed effects on cognitive load and time on task. The first study revealed significant differences of the experimental groups and on a descriptive level a reversed u-shape pattern, i.e., learning performance increases with increasing disfluency but decreases when the text becomes too illegible. The same pattern could be found significantly in the second study for recall and transfer performance, engagement and time on task and the reversed pattern for extraneous load. Results indicate that there is in fact an optimal level of disfluency on performance that comes along with increased engagement and that there is a breaking point of disfluency where the extraneous load seems to be too high.},

On the other hand, Dennett holds that self-knowledge is illusory. We argue that Dennett's view about the role of inner speech ultimately entails that there is a limit to the deceiving powers of user-friendly apps.

 abstract = {The aim of this research was to develop and evaluate tools and supports for self-regulated learning with hypertext information structures, such as Web pages. Two kinds of supports for self-regulated learning were developed and tested experimentally: Prompting and Prompting with Training. In Experiment 1, Prompting was tested with a pre-post-test between subject design, including thinking-aloud data. Students of the experimental group (n = 20) were prompted for self-regulation activities that had to be followed while learning basic learning theory. No self-regulation support was offered in the control group (n = 20). In Experiment 2 (Prompting with Training), the experimental group (n = 20) received a short training, in addition to the prompting: the self-regulated learning activities were explained in detail, demonstrated and practiced right before the learning session. Again, no self-regulation support was offered in the control group (n = 20). Analyses of learning processes and learning outcomes confirm partly the positive effects of both measures of self-regulated learning prompts. The more extended measure (with training) had superior effects on students' learning transfer performance and acceptance. Implications for the design of instructional support to improve self-regulated learning with computer-based learning environments are discussed.},

 abstract = {Self-assessment and task selection are important self-regulated learning skills for secondary school students. More specifically, selecting new tasks based on self-assessments is very important for them, because teachers are not always present or able to select tasks for them individually. However, little is known about the processes underlying these self-regulated learning skills, and thus no guidelines exist for teaching self-assessment and the selection of subsequent learning-tasks. We propose a model for self-regulated learning-task selection (SRLTS) which represents a possible pathway for the task-selection process, and which students could use as a norm when making task selections. The model could help students to decide what possible new tasks might be suitable for their current skill level, based on self-assessments. The aim of this study is to evaluate to what extent secondary school students select learning tasks according to this model, and whether they use self-assessments to this end. Secondary school students (N = 15) selected learning tasks in the domain of genetics from a structured task database. The tasks varied in difficulty and amount of support provided (i.e., completion problems vs. traditional problems). We used eye tracking, performance estimates, estimates of mental effort, judgments of learning, and open questions to gain more insight in what students focus on and think about when selecting a task. Results suggest that students roughly follow the SRLTS model, but they base their decisions on inaccurate self-assessments. This implies that students might benefit from self-assessment and task-selection advice, which could provide feedback on self-assessments and stimulate students to use self-assessment information as input for task selection in the way the model prescribes to optimize their learning.},

 abstract = {Instructional design deals with the optimization of learning processes. To achieve this, three aspects need to be considered: (1) the learning task itself, (2) the design of the learning material, and (3) the activation of the learner’s cognitive processes during learning. Based on Cognitive Load Theory, learners also need to deal with the task itself, the design of the material, and the decision on how much to invest into learning. To link these concepts, and to help instructional designers and teachers, cognitive load during learning needs to be differentially measured. This article reviews studies using a questionnaire to measure intrinsic, extraneous and germane cognitive load in order to provide evidence for the instruments’ prognostic validity. Six exemplary studies from different domains with different variations of the learning material were chosen to show that the theoretically expected effects on different types of load are actually reflected in the learners’ answers in the questionnaire. Major hypotheses regarding the different load types were (1) variations in difficulty are reflected in the scale on intrinsic cognitive load, (2) variations in design are reflected in the scale on extraneous cognitive load, and (3) variations in enhancing deeper learning through activation of cognitive processes are reflected in the scale on germane cognitive load. We found prognostic validity to be good. The review concludes by discussing the practical and theoretical implications, as well as pointing out the limitations and needs for further research.},

 abstract = {While, prima facie, virtue/credit approaches in epistemology would appear to be in tension with distributed/extended approaches in cognitive science, Pritchard (2010) has recently argued that the tension here is only apparent, at least given a weak version of distributed cognition, which claims merely that external resources often make critical contributions to the formation of true belief, and a weak virtue theory, which claims merely that, whenever a subject achieves knowledge, his cognitive agency makes a significant contribution to the formation of a true belief. But the significance of the role played by the subject’s cognitive agency in distributed cognitive systems is in fact highly variable: at one extreme, formation of a true belief seems clearly to be significantly creditable to the subject’s agency; at the other extreme, however, the subject’s agency plays such a peripheral role that it is at best unclear whether it should receive significant credit for formation of a true belief. The compatibility of distributed cognition and virtue epistemology thus turns on what it takes for a contribution to the formation of true belief to count as significant. This article argues that the inevitable vagueness of this notion suggests retreating from virtue epistemology to a form of process reliabilism and explores the prospects for a distributed reliabilist epistemology designed to fit smoothly with distributed cognition. In effect, distributed reliabilism radicalizes Goldberg’s recent extended reliabilist view (Goldberg 2010) by allowing the process the reliability of which determines the epistemic status of a subject’s belief to extend to include not only processing performed by other subjects but also processing performed by non-human technological resources.},

 abstract = {Compositionality, or the ability to build complex cognitive structures from simple parts, is fundamental to the power of the human mind. Here we relate this principle to the psychometric concept of fluid intelligence, traditionally measured with tests of complex reasoning. Following the principle of compositionality, we propose that the critical function in fluid intelligence is splitting a complex whole into simple, separately attended parts. To test this proposal, we modify traditional matrix reasoning problems to minimize requirements on information integration, workingmemory, and processing speed, creating problems that are trivial once effectively divided into parts. Performance remains poor in participants with low fluid intelligence, but is radically improved by problem layout that aids cognitive segmentation. In line with the principle of compositionality, we suggest that effective cognitive segmentation is important in all organized behavior, explaining the broad role of fluid intelligence in successful cognition.},

 abstract = {Purpose:Software makers nowadays regularly post videos on their websites to satisfy their clients' need for instructional support. Some of these designs include an opportunity for practice. This study investigated whether the presence and timing of practice affected motivation and learning in video-based software training. Method:An experiment is reported with four conditions: video-practice (VP), practice-video (PV), practice-video-practice (PVP), and video only (V). For motivation, the study assessed mood states and flow experience during training. In addition, task relevance and self-efficacy were measured before and after training. Learning was assessed with several performance tests for trained tasks. In addition, a transfer test was administered. Results:The findings for presence of practice were mixed. Practice increased training time and led to more negative mood states during training. A clear advantage of practice was found only on the transfer test. The findings for timing of practice favored a sequence in which instruction preceded practice. Perplexing results were found for the PVP condition. The highest learning gains were expected for this condition, but, instead, this condition had the lowest performance scores on a practice test and immediate post-test. Conclusion:This study indicates that the design issue of whether or not to complement video-based software training with practice is more complex than it seems.},

 abstract = {The human brain processes a wide variety of inputs and does so either consciously or subconsciously. According to the global workspace theory, conscious processing involves broadcasting of information to several regions of the brain and subconscious processing involves more localized information processing. This paper expands on some of the aspects of the theory: how the properties of incoming information result in the input being processed subconsciously or consciously; why processing can either be sustained or short-lived; how the global workspace theory may apply both to real-time sensory input as well as to internally retained information. This paper proposes that: familiar input which evokes weak emotions becomes processed subconsciously and such processing can be continuous and sustained; input that elicits stronger emotions is subjected to highly sustainable conscious processing; input can also undergo meta-conscious processing. Such processing is not very sustainable but can exert control over other cognitive processes. This paper also discusses possible benefits of regulating cognitive processes this way.},

The second treats association as a feature of the kind of psychological mechanism associative processing. Both of these views are inadequate. I argue that association should instead be seen as a highly abstract filler term, standing in for causal relations between representational states in a system. Associations, so viewed, could be implemented by many different mechanisms.

Two eighth grade classes (N = 63) participated in six weekly question-generation sessions to support English learning. An online student question-generation learning system was adopted. In contrast to expectations based on the literature on observational learning and scaffolding, no significant differences in English academic performance and weekly question-generation performance were found between the groups with and without online access to peer-generated questions. Nonetheless, the question-viewing function of the system used in this work induced a significant and immediate increase in QG performance for the group with access. Possible reasons for the unexpected non-significant results are provided with reference to limited attention theory and cognitive load theory, along with the significance of this study, as well as suggestions for instructional implementations and future research.},

Two questions are addressed: What are the characteristics of productive learning processes that are required in order to acquire AC?, and How can such learning be stimulated and sustained through instruction?

 abstract = {Subjective cognitive load (CL) rating scales are widely used in educational research. However, there are still some open questions regarding the point of time at which such scales should be applied. Whereas some studies apply rating scales directly after each step or task and use an average of these ratings, others assess CL only once after the whole learning or problem-solving phase. To investigate if these two approaches are comparable indicators of experienced CL, two experiments were conducted, in which 168 and 107 teacher education university students, respectively, worked through a sequence of six problems. CL was assessed by means of subjective ratings of mental effort and perceived task difficulty after each problem and after the whole process. Results showed that the delayed ratings of both effort and difficulty were significantly higher than the average of the six ratings made during problem solving. In addition, the problems we assumed to be of higher complexity seemed to be the best predictors for the delayed ratings. Interestingly, for ratings of affective variables, such as interest and motivation, the delayed rating did not differ from the average of immediate ratings.},

The resource delivers an automated, online form of strategy instruction outside of class time, facilitating self-paced learning with sufficient practice and feedback. In addition to the L2 lexicography, vocabulary, and strategy literatures, the project is informed by instructional design principles aimed at 1) managing demands on learners' cognitive processing capacities; 2) differentiating materials so as to appropriately target declarative or procedural forms of knowledge or the integration and coordination of the two; and 3) harnessing the computer's multimedia capabilities in principled ways. It seeks to address a number of related issues in second language studies including: the fact that pedagogical dictionaries go largely under-exploited and misused by their target audience; the apparent lack of understanding of collocational relationships among many L2 learners of English; the challenge of providing strategy instruction cost-effectively; and the need to facilitate more strategic and self-directed use of CALL resources.},

 abstract = {Four experiments investigated whether the testing effect also applies to the acquisition of problem-solving skills from worked examples. Experiment 1 (n=120) showed no beneficial effects of testing consisting of isomorphic problem solving or example recall on final test performance, which consisted of isomorphic problem solving, compared to continued study of isomorphic examples. Experiment 2 (n=124) showed no beneficial effects of testing consisting of identical problem solving compared to restudying an identical example. Interestingly, participants who took both an immediate and a delayed final test outperformed those taking only a delayed test. This finding suggested that testing might become beneficial for retention but only after a certain level of schema acquisition has taken place through restudying several examples. However, experiment 2 had no control condition restudying examples instead of taking the immediate test. Experiment 3 (n=129) included such a restudy condition, and there was no evidence that testing after studying four examples was more effective for final delayed test performance than restudying, regardless of whether restudied/tested problems were isomorphic or identical. Experiment 4 (n=75) used a similar design as experiment 3 (i.e., testing/restudy after four examples), but with examples on a different topic and with a different participant population. Again, no evidence of a testing effect was found. Thus, across four experiments, with different types of initial tests, different problem-solving domains, and different participant populations, we found no evidence that testing enhanced delayed test performance compared to restudy. These findings suggest that the testing effect might not apply to acquiring problem-solving skills from worked examples.},

 abstract = {The present study investigated the utility of an instructional strategy known as the query method for enhancing learning outcomes in computer-based training. The query method involves an embedded guided, sentence generation task requiring elaboration of key concepts in the training material that encourages learners to 'stop and think' about the information already presented before proceeding to new concepts. This study also investigated the effect of varying the level of elaboration (low or high) prompted by the queries. Fifty-one undergraduate students from the general psychology department subject pool at a major university in the southeastern United States received instruction on the basic principles of flight via one of three versions of a computer-based tutorial (no query, low-level elaboration query, or high-level elaboration query). Participants had no prior knowledge or previous experience with the aviation domain. A one-way between-groups design was employed, with the query method serving as the independent variable and a sample size of 17 per condition. Dependent variables included knowledge organization, knowledge acquisition, and instructional efficiency. Overall, results showed that incorporating lowlevel elaboration queries into the training resulted in improved organization, integration, and application of task-relevant knowledge and higher instructional efficiency. High-level elaboration queries consistently failed to produce significantly better post-training outcomes, possibly due to the increased cognitive load imposed on learners during training. The discussion centers on theoretical and practical implications for promoting and assessing learning outcomes in computer-based training.},

The investigation of online searching generally employs methods including a survey, interview, screen-capturing, or transactional logs. The present study firstly intended to utilize a survey, the Online Information Searching Strategies Inventory (OISSI), to examine users' searching strategies in terms of control, orientation, trial and error, problem solving, purposeful thinking, selecting main ideas, and evaluation, which is defined as implicit strategies. Second, this study conducted screen-capturing to investigate the students' searching behaviors regarding the number of keywords, the quantity and depth of Web page exploration, and time attributes, which is defined as explicit strategies. Ultimately, this study explored the role that these two types of strategies played in predicting the students' online science information searching outcomes. A total of 103 Grade 10 students were recruited from a high school in northern Taiwan. Through Pearson correlation and multiple regression analyses, the results showed that the students' explicit strategies, particularly the time attributes proposed in the present study, were more successful than their implicit strategies in predicting their outcomes of searching science information. The participants who spent more time on detailed reading (explicit strategies) and had better skills of evaluating Web information (implicit strategies) tended to have superior searching performance.},

At that time, constructivism, learning styles, and Kolb’s theory were, for practical purposes, the only learning theories engineering educators were aware of. During the intervening twenty years engineering education has realized that student learning is the objective of the entire enterprise. This realization has made learning theories a very important part of engineering education and one of the five key research areas identified by the Engineering Education Research Colloquies (Special Report, 2006) and adopted by the Journal of Engineering Education as},

 abstract = {In the present study, the ways in which digital learning tasks contribute to students' intrinsic motivation and learning outcomes were examined. In particular, this study explored the relative contributions of autonomy support and the provision of structure in digital learning tasks. Participants were 320 fifth- and sixth-grade students from eight elementary schools throughout the Netherlands. The results show that a digital learning task that combined autonomy support and structure had a positive effect on both intrinsic motivation and learning outcomes in students. A digital learning task that only provided structure also had a positive effect on learning outcomes, but a digital learning task with only autonomy support did not yield a similar effect.},

 abstract = {Robust knowledge serves as a common instructional target in academic settings. Past research identifying characteristics of experts' knowledge across many domains can help clarify the features of robust knowledge as well as ways of assessing it. We review the expertise literature and identify three key features of robust knowledge (deep, connected, and coherent) and four means of assessing these features (perception, memory, problem solving, and transfer). Focusing on the domains of math and science learning, we examine how four instructional techniques— practice, worked examples, analogical comparison, and self-explanation—can promote key features of robust knowledge and how those features can be assessed. We conclude by discussing the implications of this framework for theory and practice.},

 abstract = {This "Research Commentary" explores the roles of theoretical and empirical work in the development of productive lines of research. It elaborates on 3 main points. First, the dialectic between theory and empirical practice is highly productive for both: Theory is enriched by close attention to data, and one's understanding of empirical issues is deepened when one attends closely to theory. Second, an effective mechanism for making systematic progress is to focus on cases at the edge of one's (and the field's) collective theoretical understanding. Third, close observations of empirical phenomena often raise issues that have theoretical import and that give rise to new lines of work. These 3 points, and implications, are illustrated with examples from my research.},

Evolutionary developmental biology can provide valuable new insights into issues such as the domain-specificity of the human mind, the nature-nurture debate, stages in development, and the origin of individual differences. Evolutionary developmental biology provides evidence for the hypotheses that domain-general and domain-specific abilities co-occur, that nature and nurture interact in a dynamic and nonadditive way, that stages occur in development, and that individual differences are the result of pleiotropic effects during development.},

 abstract = {Psychological explanations of philosophical intuitions can help us assess their evidentiary value, and our warrant for accepting them. To explain and assess conceptual or classificatory intuitions about specific situations, some philosophers have suggested explanations which invoke heuristic rules proposed by cognitive psychologists. The present paper extends this approach of intuition assessment by heuristics-based explanation, in two ways: It motivates the proposal of a new heuristic, and shows that this metaphor heuristic helps explain important but neglected intuitions: general factual intuitions which have been highly influential in the philosophies of mind and perception but neglected in ongoing debates in the epistemology of philosophy. To do so, the paper integrates results from three philosophically pertinent but hitherto largely unconnected strands of psychological research: research on intuitive judgement, analogy and metaphor, and memory-based processing, respectively. The paper shows that the heuristics-based explanation thus obtained satisfies the key requirements cognitive psychologists impose on such explanations, that it can explain the philosophical intuitions targeted, and that this explanation supports normative assessment of the intuitions' evidentiary value: It reveals whether particular intuitions are due to proper exercise of cognitive competencies or constitute cognitive illusions.},

First, it is explained how SDL is implemented in PBL environments. Similarities between SDL and SRL are highlighted. However, both concepts differ on important aspects. SDL includes an additional premise of giving students a broader role in the selection and evaluation of learning materials. SDL can encompass SRL, but the opposite does not hold. Further, a review of empirical studies on SDL and SRL in PBL was conducted. Results suggested that SDL and SRL are developmental processes, that the "self" aspect is crucial, and that PBL can foster SDL. It is concluded that conceptual clarity of what SDL entails and guidance for both teachers and students can help PBL to bring forth self-directed learners.},

Across four parallel experiments, university students completed an online module on critical thinking. In Experiment 1, participants who were prompted on a broad spectrum of study strategies showed superior performance on a subsequent test of application relative to a control group. In Experiment 2, participants were prompted to use two specific strategies: generation of explanations and summarization. The former improved performance, whereas the latter did not. In Experiment 3, instructional aids designed to facilitate planning improved some aspects of performance relative to the control group. In Experiment 4, attempts to encourage self-feedback impaired performance. In conclusion, beyond encouraging a broad spectrum of study strategies, the generation of explanations and planning particularly improve learning without overburdening working memory.},

 abstract = {This essay first summarizes an overarching theory of cognitive organization and development. This theory claims that the human mind involves (1) several specialized structural systems dealing with different domains of relations in the environment, (2) a central representational capacity system, (3) general inferential processes, and (4) consciousness. These systems interact dynamically during development so that changes in each are related to changes in others. The changes in all systems and the change mechanisms are described. This theory integrates research and theorizing from cognitive, developmental, and differential psychology. Based on this theory, a model for education is proposed that specifies, first, educational priorities for different phases of development according to the cognitive developmental milestones associated with each phase. The theory also specifies how education can educate students to (1) construct mental models for the sake of conceptual change, (2) use their central representational capacity efficiently, (3) advance analogical and deductive reasoning, (4) learn how to learn, and (5) become critical and creative thinkers. The theory is offered as an overarching paradigm for the architecture, the development, and the education of the human mind.},

 abstract = {Despite the potential advantages of instructional explanations, evidence indicates that they are usually ineffective. Subsequent work has shown that in order to make instructional explanations effective indeed, one successful strategy is to combine them with indications of the limitations in learners' understanding that they are intended to revise, which makes learners deeply process the explanations. We explored whether this is so for both learners with low and those with high prior domain knowledge. In one experiment, 77 participants with low and high prior knowledge learned about plate tectonics from a multimedia presentation. In addition to the presentation, half the participants received instructional explanations combined with indications, whereas the rest received instructional explanations with no indications. After using the materials, the participants solved retention and transfer tests. Results showed that low prior knowledge learners learned more from explanations including indications of their misunderstandings, whereas high prior knowledge learners profited from instructional explanations either with or without the indications. We discussed theoretical and practical implications.},

The advent of such a program has allowed for innovations in higher education for the predominantly minority populations who attend these universities; furthermore, using problem-based learning as a pedagogical approach for the yearlong administrative internship has proven to be a sound method for this clientele. The elements and characteristics of problem-based learning provide the context that suited candidates in the program of focus here. These candidates had established the practice of working together in the classroom such that it was a natural progression to the field internship as a problem-solving activity that gave them autonomy and control, as well as the chance to practice the collaborative skills garnered during the classroom activities with fellow students. This article presents examples of three case studies drawn from projects identified by practicing administrators who served as mentors for students.},

To study the limits of conscious reportability, we designed a novel method of quantified introspection, in which subjects were asked, after each trial of a standard cognitive task, to estimate the time spent completing the task. We then applied classical mental-chronometry techniques, such as the additive-factors method, to analyze these introspective estimates of response time. We demonstrate that introspective response time can be a sensitive measure, tightly correlated with objective response time in a single-task context. In a psychological-refractory-period task, however, the objective processing delay resulting from interference by a second concurrent task is totally absent from introspective estimates. These results suggest that introspective estimates of time spent on a task tightly correlate with the period of availability of central processing resources.},

 abstract = {Cognitive load theory has been very influential in educational psychology during the last decade in providing guidelines for instructional design. Whereas numerous empirical studies have used it as a theoretical framework, a closer analysis reveals some fundamental conceptual problems within the theory. Various generalizations of empirical findings become questionable because the theory allows different and contradicting possibilities to explain some empirical results. The article investigates these theoretical problems by analyzing the conceptual distinctions between different kinds of cognitive load. It emphasizes that reduction of cognitive load can sometimes impair learning rather than enhancing it. Cognitive load theory is reconsidered both from the perspective of Vygotski's concept of the zone of proximal development and from the perspective of research on implicit learning. Task performance and learning are considered as related, but nevertheless fundamentally different processes. Conclusions are drawn for the further development of the theory as well as for empirical research and instructional practice.},

Analysis of this evidence indicates that experts' free recall of strategies introduces errors and omissions into instructional materials that hinder student success. In contrast, when experts engage in structured knowledge elicitation techniques (e.g., cognitive task analysis), the resultant instruction is more effective.

 abstract = {Cet article a pour objectif d'analyser la confiance du conducteur pendant sa coopération avec un régulateur de la vitesse intelligent (Adaptive Cruise Control ou ACC). Le cadre théorique de référence est celui de la Coopération Humain-Machine. L'idée principale qui a guidé notre travail est que dans un système humain-machine coopératif, la confiance dans la coopération avec la machine est l'élément déterminant des interactions de l'opérateur avec la machine. Nous avons effectué une expérimentation sur un mini-simulateur de conduite et en utilisant un ACC dont la vitesse et l'interdistance de consigne étaient pré fixées respectivement à 130 km/h et 1,5 s. Une présentation sur diapositives de ce qu'est un ACC a été élaborée. 23 conducteurs ont participé à l'expérimentation, âgés en moyenne de 26 ans et titulaire du permis de conduire depuis six ans en moyenne. Les participants ont visionné une présentation sur diapositives sur ce qu'est un ACC puis ont répondu à un questionnaire destiné à mesurer la confiance avant interaction avec le dispositif. Après les essais de familiarisation avec le simulateur et avec l'ACC, les participants ont passé trois essais expérimentaux identiques, le dernier se distinguant par la présence de brouillard. Un deuxième type de questionnaire sur la confiance après interaction avec l'ACC était complété après chaque essai. Les variables dépendantes étaient les scores aux questionnaires, le nombre de désactivations de l'ACC, le pourcentage de temps d'utilisation du dispositif et la vitesse moyenne. Les résultats montrent que le conducteur a un certain niveau de confiance avant même de commencer à conduire avec l'ACC. Globalement, il semble que les interactions avec l'ACC peuvent s'expliquer par une confiance, globale mais non spécifique, dans la coopération conducteur-ACC, celle-ci résultant d'une combinaison de deux types de confiance spécifiques: la confiance dans l'ACC et la confiance en soi. Seule la confiance dans l'ACC semble être affectée par le brouillard, la confiance globale dans la coopération conducteur-ACC ayant tendance à s'améliorer avec l'expérience du dispositif malgré la présence de brouillard. La discussion est axée sur la faiblesse de la méthode utilisée ainsi que sur les implications des résultats obtenus sur l'apprentissage de la coopération avec les aides à la conduite. This paper examines driver trust during cooperation with an Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC), an Intelligent Driver Support System that can replace drivers for the longitudinal control of a vehicle. We present a theoretical framework based on the construct of trust in the cooperation between the operator and the automated control. An experiment was carried out using a mini-driving-simulator and an ACC with a preset reference speed and time headway of 130 km/h and 1.5 s, respectively. Questionnaires were used to analyse drivers trust. The main finding of the study is that the distinction between trust in ACC and trust in the cooperation with the device seems to be relevant. Trust in the cooperation with ACC seems to result from a combination of self-confidence and trust in ACC. The results are discussed in terms of the weaknesses in the methodology.},

 abstract = {The present studies were conducted to investigate students' conceptions of distinct constructivist assumptions. To that end, a questionnaire was developed containing statements about four constructivist assumptions: The importance of knowledge construction, cooperative learning, self-regulation, and the use of authentic problems together with self-perceived inability to learn and motivation to learn. The studies demonstrate that the questionnaire was able to unearth students' conceptions of the distinctiveness of constructivist assumptions. Students were able to identify the six factors underlying the questionnaire, as indicated by the fit of the hypothesized model. The test for measurement invariance showed that factor loadings were equivalent across groups and that the questionnaire's underlying factor structure gave evidence of cross-validation. Testing alternative models with one and three latent factors resulted in poor model fits, supporting the questionnaire's latent factor structure. The questionnaire developed appeared an adequate instrument to investigate students' conceptions of constructivist assumptions of learning and students acknowledge the importance of these assumptions as distinct influences on their learning process. Les études en question ont été menées afin d'examiner les conceptions des étudiants quant aux principes constructivistes. Le questionnaire, mis au point a cette fin, contient quatre piliers de conceptions constructivistes: l'importance de la construction cognitive, l'apprentissage cooper-off, l'autorégulation, et l'emploi de problèmes authentiques conjointement avec l'incertitude de l'apprentissage et la motivation d'étudier. Ces études démontrent que le questionnaire était capable de mettre en évidence les conceptions que se faisaient les étudiants a propos du caractère distinctif des principes constructifs. Les étudiants étaient capables d'identifier les six facteurs sous-jacents au questionnaire, comme la forme du modèle d'hypothèses l'indique. Le test visant à mesurer la constance a révélé que les analyses factorielles (le poids des facteurs) étaient équivalentes entre les groupes et que la structure des facteurs implicite du questionnaire a mis en évidence la validation croisée. Le modèle a six facteurs a été mis a l'épreuve vis-à-vis des modèles d'un facteur versus trois facteurs. Les analyses factorielles confirment que le modèle a six facteurs révèle la solution la plus optimale et que les autres modèles révèlent des solutions sub-optimales. Apparentement, le questionnaire permet de développer un instrument utile pour étudier la conception qu'ont les étudiants a propos des principes constructivistes de l'apprentissage. De même, les étudiants comprennent l'importance de ces suppositions en les considérants comme des influences directes de leur processus d'apprentissage.},

 abstract = {This article reviews the corpus of research on feedback, with a focus on formative feedback--defined as information communicated to the learner that is intended to modify his or her thinking or behavior to improve learning. According to researchers, formative feedback should be nonevaluative, supportive, timely, and specific. Formative feedback is usually presented as information to a learner in response to some action on the learner's part. It comes in a variety of types (e.g., verification of response accuracy, explanation of the correct answer, hints, worked examples) and can be administered at various times during the learning process (e.g., immediately following an answer, after some time has elapsed). Finally, several variables have been shown to interact with formative feedback's success at promoting learning (e.g., individual characteristics of the learner and aspects of the task). All of these issues are discussed. This review concludes with guidelines for generating formative feedback.},

 abstract = {This article argues for the need to reconcile symbolist and connectionist accounts of (second) language learning by propounding nine claims, aimed at integrating accounts of the representation, processing and acquisition of second language (L2) knowledge. Knowledge representation is claimed to be possible both in the form of symbols and rules and in the form of networks with layers of hidden units representing knowledge in a distributed, subsymbolic way. Implicit learning is the construction of knowledge in the form of such networks. The strength of association between the network nodes changes in the beginning stages of learning with accumulating exposure, following a power law (automatization). Network parts may attain the status equivalent to 'symbols'. Explicit learning is the deliberate construction of verbalizable knowledge in the form of symbols (concepts) and rules. The article argues for a nonnativist, emergentist view of first language learning and adopts its own version of what could be called a non-interface position in L2 learning: although explicit knowledge cannot turn into implicit knowledge through practice, it is argued that explicit learning and practice often form efficient ways of mastering an L2 by creating opportunities for implicit learning.},

 abstract = {Worked examples are instructional devices that provide an expert's problem solution for a learner to study. Worked-examples research is a cognitive-experimental program that has relevance to classroom instruction and the broader educational research community. A framework for organizing the findings of this research is proposed, leading to instructional design principles. For instance, one instructional design principle suggests that effective examples have highly integrated components. They employ multiple modalities in presentation and emphasize conceptual structure by labeling or segmenting. At the lesson level, effective instruction employs multiple examples for each conceptual problem type, varies example formats within problem type, and employs surface features to signal deep structure. Also, examples should be presented in close proximity to matched practice problems. Moreover, learners can be encouraged through direct training or by the structure of the worked example to actively self-explain examples. Worked examples are associated with early stages of skill development, but the design principles are relevant to constructivist research and teaching.},

 abstract = {Subjects read brief paragraphs containing contradictory statements. Many of the subjects failed to notice the contradiction. On a subsequent recall test, nondetectors frequently either recalled only one or neither of the contradictory statements or explained the contradiction away. The construction integration model of discourse comprehension is used to simulate these results. Failures to detect contradictions are accounted for by assuming that nondetectors believe too strongly in the global text interpretations they create or in their prior beliefs. In the model, this means that their comprehension processes are normal, except that one normal component of comprehension--differential weighting of important statements--is exaggerated.},

 abstract = {This article examines a range of issues related to the development of nonstandard methods for the analysis of videotapes of problem-solving sessions. It proposes some rather stringent standards for novel methods, standards concerned with issues of validity, reliability, and the communication of methods and data. The discussion is illustrated by the detailed examination of two case studies that employ two different grain sizes of analysis - the first macroscopic, the second microscopic. In the light of those case studies, theoretical issues regarding the relationships among theory-based, method-based, and problem-based approaches to programmatic research in the learning sciences are considered.},

 abstract = {Contemporary cognitive science has created the possibility of an educational learning theory closely related to existing cognitive theories but operative at a higher level of description. Issues that must be addressed in developing such a theory are: How much of the external world should be included in cognitive descriptions, how to avoid degenerate functionalism, what needs explaining by an educational learning theory, and what its units of analysis should be. It is proposed that a constitutive problem for educational learning theory is the explanation of difficult learning. A unit of analysis called a contextual module is proposed and applied to this problem. An advantage of contextual modules is that they treat environmental situatedness as an emergent property resulting from reasonably well understood processes.},
