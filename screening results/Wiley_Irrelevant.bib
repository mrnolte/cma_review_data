	abstract = {The study of neuroanatomy imposes a significant cognitive load on students since it includes huge factual information and therefore demands diverse learning strategies. In addition, a significant amount of teaching is carried out through human brain demonstrations, due to limited opportunities for cadaveric dissection. However, reports suggest that students often attend these demonstrations with limited preparation, which detrimentally impacts their learning. In the context of student learning, greater levels of engagement and intrinsic motivation (IM) are associated with better academic performance. However, the maintenance of engagement and the IM of students in neuroanatomy is often challenging for educators. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the role of prelaboratory assignments (PLAs) in the improvement of academic performance, augmentation of engagement, and enhancement of IM in occupational therapy students enrolled in a human neuroanatomy course. One cohort of students in the course was expected to complete PLAs prior to each brain demonstration session. The PLAs contained a list of structures, and students were expected to write a brief anatomical description of each structure. Another cohort of students who were not provided with similar PLAs constituted the control group. Students who completed PLAs had a higher score on the final examinations as compared to students who were not required to complete PLAs. These students also demonstrated greater engagement and IM, and indicated that they perceived PLAs to be valuable in the learning of neuroanatomy. Therefore, PLAs represent a useful teaching tool in the neuroanatomy curriculum.},

	abstract = {Abstract In multimedia learning research, pictures are commonly used to visually represent corresponding written texts, generating substantial research on how to apply multimedia principles to more effectively design instructional materials. However, it is still unclear what types of pictures presented in testing, with or without additional instructional supports, enhance learning from spoken messages. To address this gap, the present experiment recruited 184 university students and employed a 2 (representational vs. decorative pictures) × 2 (cueing vs. no cueing) between-subjects factorial design. Specifically, this study investigated the effects of adding decorative (aesthetic, interest enhancing), as compared to representational (content depicting) pictures, to test items with or without the opportunity to preview such items (cueing) on learning and learning judgments. The results showed significant main effects of picture type and cueing, as well as a significant interaction effect on listening comprehension. That is, cueing neutralized the negative impact of decorative pictures, but did not improve learning when representational pictures were used. In addition, representational pictures led to significantly higher learning judgments than did decorative pictures. The detrimental effect of decorative pictures and the compensating effect of cueing on decorative pictures in testing were confirmed in the listening comprehension scenario.},

	abstract = {Abstract This chapter reviews current key questions, issues, and findings in the study of atypical cognitive development, as well as the history of earlier research on this topic. Key questions include (1) How general versus specific are the processes of cognitive development and individual differences in cognition? (2) What is the etiology of cognitive development and individual cognitive differences? (3) How do these etiologies act on structural and functional brain development? (4) How malleable are developmental and individual cognitive outcomes? and (5) How similar are the answers to these four questions in youth and aging? A key issue that runs throughout the chapter is the role of nature versus nurture in the development of physical and psychological forms. The resolution to this issue is found in the principles of probabilistic epigenesis, constructivism, and complex systems that self-organize to yield emergent properties. The chapter describes a multilevel, interdisciplinary approach that is needed to understand atypical cognitive development. Besides behavioral and cognitive development, these levels include (a) etiology (genetic and environmental influences and their interplay) and (b) brain mechanisms. Specific examples of atypical cognitive development are described to illustrate these levels of analysis and to address key issues. These examples include (a) amblyopia, (b) orphanage rearing, (c) three genetic syndromes that produce intellectual disability (i.e., Down syndrome, fragile X syndrome, and Williams syndrome; (d) early treated phenylketonuria; and (e) developmental dyslexia. The chapter concludes with a summary of current answers to the five key questions and implications for future research.}

	abstract = {Summary The metacognitive theory and treatment of psychological disorders is described. It is proposed that all disorders are linked to the activation of a specific style of thinking that prolongs psychological distress. This style is called the Cognitive Attentional Syndrome (CAS) and consists of worry, rumination, threat-monitoring, and self-regulatory behaviors that have paradoxical effects. The CAS results from metacognition, of which positive and negative beliefs are central. Metacognitive therapy aims to reduce the CAS and modify such metacognitions. It does not target the content of cognition per se, but works directly on the control of thinking and the content of metacognitive beliefs. This treatment is illustrated with reference to a case of generalized anxiety. Data supporting the theory and the effectiveness of MCT are reviewed.}

Here I analyze situations in which one reacts in cold blood to danger and argue that the formal object of fear is not the dangerous, but the unsafe. The unsafe indicates not only how the world is, but also how it can be handled. Safety, and its negative counterpart, are characterized by their duality, both evaluative (is the snake dangerous?) and agentive (is it under control?).}

While technical in nature, business analytics and big data are likely to disrupt much of what we take for granted, creating an era of uncertainty where competitive threats and market risks are increasingly hard to predict. This chapter outlines five trends that will force businesses to either adapt or exit. These include the increasingly unpredictability of opportunities and risk due to systematic complexity, the ongoing elimination of experience as a source of differentiation, the tightening of the labor market, the rise of information as a proprietary asset, and the need to shift from planned to unplanned yet robust business models.}

In this commentary, we draw connections between this work and similar efforts in the everyday cognition tradition that emphasizes the importance of examining cognition in context. In addition, using the present contributions as inspiration, we suggest that one of the key directions for future research will be metacognitive. That is, with technology increasingly performing cognitive functions for us, understanding how we monitor and control internal and external cognitive resources to achieve our goals represents an important and exciting new frontier in cognitive psychology.},

	abstract = {Abstract Artificial Intelligence (AI) powered machines are increasingly mediating our work and many of our managerial, economic, and cultural interactions. While technology enhances individual capability in many ways, how do we know that the sociotechnical system as a whole, consisting of a complex web of hundreds of human–machine interactions, is exhibiting collective intelligence? Research on human–machine interactions has been conducted within different disciplinary silos, resulting in social science models that underestimate technology and vice versa. Bringing together these different perspectives and methods at this juncture is critical. To truly advance our understanding of this important and quickly evolving area, we need vehicles to help research connect across disciplinary boundaries. This paper advocates for establishing an interdisciplinary research domain—Collective Human-Machine Intelligence (COHUMAIN). It outlines a research agenda for a holistic approach to designing and developing the dynamics of sociotechnical systems. In illustrating the kind of approach, we envision in this domain, we describe recent work on a sociocognitive architecture, the transactive systems model of collective intelligence, that articulates the critical processes underlying the emergence and maintenance of collective intelligence and extend it to human–AI systems. We connect this with synergistic work on a compatible cognitive architecture, instance-based learning theory and apply it to the design of AI agents that collaborate with humans. We present this work as a call to researchers working on related questions to not only engage with our proposal but also develop their own sociocognitive architectures and unlock the real potential of human–machine intelligence.}

Then we examine fundamental limitations of feature vectors and other distributed representations that, despite their recent successes on various practical problems, suggest that they are insufficient to capture many aspects of human cognition. After that, we describe the implications for cognitive architecture of our view that analogy is central, and we speculate on roles for hybrid approaches.

The present research investigates how contributors’ metacognition or self-beliefs, combine with others’ views of themselves to inform collective team states related to learning about other agents (i.e., transactive memory systems) and forming social attachments with other agents (i.e., collective team identification), both important teamwork states that have implications for team collective intelligence. We test the predictions in a longitudinal study with 78 teams. Additionally, we provide interview data from industry experts in human–artificial intelligence teams. Our findings contribute to an emerging socio-cognitive architecture for COllective HUman-MAchine INtelligence (i.e., COHUMAIN) by articulating its underpinnings in individual and collective cognition and metacognition. Our resulting model has implications for the critical inputs necessary to design and enable a higher level of integration of human and machine teammates.}

Task complexity (simple or complex) reflects the intrinsic nature of a task, while task transparency (easy or difficult) reflects an agent's ability to identify a solution strategy in a given task. We show how the CRAM cognitive architecture allows a robot to carry out simple and complex activities such as laying a table for a meal and loading a dishwasher afterward. It achieves this by using generalized action plans that exploit reasoning with modular, composable knowledge chunks representing general knowledge to transform underdetermined everyday action requests into motion plans that successfully accomplish the required task. Noting that CRAM does not yet have the ability to deal with difficult activities, we leverage insights from the situation model perspective on the cognitive mechanisms underlying flexible context-sensitive behavior with a view to extending CRAM to overcome this deficit.},

Two types of metacognitive agent were developed and compared with a non-metacognitive agent and two fixed-strategy agents. The first type of metacognitive agent (opponent perspective) takes the perspective of the opponent to anticipate the opponent's future actions and respond accordingly. The other metacognitive agent (modeler) predicts the opponent's next move based on the previous moves of the agent and the opponent. The modeler agent achieves better individual outcomes than a non-metacognitive agent and is more successful at encouraging cooperation. The opponent-perspective agent, by contrast, fails to achieve these outcomes because it lacks important information about the opponent. These simple agents provide insights regarding modeling of metacognition in more complex tasks.},

It discusses how people learn by constructing and automating cognitive schemas and how they regulate the learning processes such as self-regulated learning (SRL) and self-directed learning (SDL). The chapter describes the human cognitive architecture, including a description of induction and elaboration as basic learning processes that re/ construct cognitive schemas, and knowledge compilation and strengthening as basic learning processes that automate the cognitive schemas. It explores complex learning as a process where four basic learning processes occur simultaneously, the four-component instructional design as an approach to support complex learning and to organize the use of media and technologies. Finally, the chapter presents main conclusions and raises issues for future research.}

	abstract = {Abstract What kind of dynamic decision process do humans use to make decisions? In this article, two different types of processes are reviewed and compared: Markov and quantum. Markov processes are based on the idea that at any given point in time a decision maker has a definite and specific level of support for available choice alternatives, and the dynamic decision process is represented by a single trajectory that traces out a path across time. When a response is requested, a person's decision or judgment is generated from the current location along the trajectory. By contrast, quantum processes are founded on the idea that a person's state can be represented by a superposition over different degrees of support for available choice options, and that the dynamics of this state form a wave moving across levels of support over time. When a response is requested, a decision or judgment is constructed out of the superposition by “actualizing” a specific degree or range of degrees of support to create a definite state. The purpose of this article is to introduce these two contrasting theories, review empirical studies comparing the two theories, and identify conditions that determine when each theory is more accurate and useful than the other.

This is an important challenge for cognitive science: Building higher order computational models in this area will help characterize one of the hallmarks of human reasoning, and it will allow us to build more robust reasoning systems. This paper presents a novel assembled coherence (AC) theory of human conceptual change, whereby people revise beliefs and mental models by constructing and evaluating explanations using fragmentary, globally inconsistent knowledge. We implement AC theory with Timber, a computational model of conceptual change that revises its beliefs and generates human-like explanations in commonsense science. Timber represents domain knowledge using predicate calculus and qualitative model fragments, and uses an abductive model formulation algorithm to construct competing explanations for phenomena. Timber then (a) scores competing explanations with respect to previously accepted beliefs, using a cost function based on simplicity and credibility, (b) identifies a low-cost, preferred explanation and accepts its constituent beliefs, and then (c) greedily alters previous explanation preferences to reduce global cost and thereby revise beliefs. Consistency is a soft constraint in Timber; it is biased to select explanations that share consistent beliefs, assumptions, and causal structure with its other, preferred explanations. In this paper, we use Timber to simulate the belief changes of students during clinical interviews about how the seasons change. We show that Timber produces and revises a sequence of explanations similar to those of the students, which supports the psychological plausibility of AC theory.},

I begin by motivating the idea of software social organisms, drawing on ideas from other areas of cognitive science, and provide an analysis of the substrate capabilities that are needed in social organisms in terms closer to what is needed for computational modeling.

	abstract = {Abstract Human adults distinguish their mental event simulations along various dimensions—most prominently according to their “mnemicity”: we track whether these simulations are outcomes of past personal experiences or not (i.e., whether we are “remembering” or “imagining”). This distinction between memory and imagination is commonly thought to reflect a deep architectural distinction in the mind. Against this idea, I argue that mnemicity is not based on a fundamentalstructural difference between memories and imaginations but is instead the result of metacognitive attribution and social construction. On this attributional view, mnemicity is likely a uniquely human capacity that both serves collective functions and has been shaped by collective norms. First, on the individual level, mnemicity attribution is an outcome of metacognitive learning: it relies on acquired interpretations of the phenomenal features of mental event simulations. Such interpretations are in part acquired through interactive reminiscing with other community members. Further, how the distinction between memory and imagination is drawn is likely sensitive to cultural norms about what remembering is, when it is appropriate to claim to remember, what can be remembered, and what remembering entails. As a result, how individuals determine whether they remember or imagine is bound to be deeply enculturated. Second, mnemicity attribution solves an important collective challenge: who to grant epistemic authority about the past. Solving this challenge is important because—for humans—the past represents not just an opportunity to learn about the future but to coordinate present social realities. How a community determines such social realities both draws on individuals’ remembering and in turn shapes when, what, and how individuals remember.},

The concept of integration of a cognitive system has been used to address this question. For true belief to be creditable to a person’s ability, it is claimed, the relevant informational processes must be or become part of the cognitive character of the agent, as a result of a process of enculturation. We argue that this view does not capture the role of sensitivity to epistemic norms in forming true beliefs.
