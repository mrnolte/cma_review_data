abstract="Informatics education at the lower school levels is customarily interpreted as dexterity with the ICTs. However, in our view the importance of such operational abilities has been overstated, whereas the underlying learning objectives and the actual impact on children's intellectual development are still to be clarified. In this paper we consider a different educational perspective, whose primary aim is to provide children with appropriate mental scaffolding for computer science concepts and methodologies, many of which will be learned only later. Rather than exposing the pupils to a broad span of computing ideas, we essentially focus on representational codes and their potential to disclose new information by simple formal manipulations. Our approach is inspired by the early historical developments of ideas and tools, that allows us: (i) to propose engaging tasks within a background portrayed in the narrative register; (ii) to draw links with the topics of the specific history and mathematics syllabi; (iii) to reflect, at a meta-level, on the cognitive demands of relevant cultural achievements and on their pedagogical implications. After outlining our experience with pupils aged 6 and 9-10, we will briefly discuss children's subjective perception and feedback, in particular as to the retention of the material learned.",

abstract="Internet of Things (IoT) technology will be used in a wide range of applications such as healthcare and transportation. Because of distributed and dynamic nature of IoT-based systems, designing management algorithms for them results in challenging problems. On the other hand, cognitive computing refers to systems that emulate cognitive processes inspired by human thinking processes for solving problems. The Cognitive Internet of Things (CIoT) technology refers to a combination of cognitive systems and IoT. A benefit of this technology is that the management problems of the IoT will be solved by solutions that come from cognitive systems domain. In recent years, CIoT has received much attention. This is because the management algorithms of the IoT are very complex and therefore human thinking processes as computerized cognitive processes are required for fast and accurate decision-making. Existing algorithms reported as management mechanisms for CIoT only focus on utilizing artificial intelligence without considering fundamental issues of cognitive systems such as predictability, controllability, responsibility, safety, security, and energy consumption. Ignoring these issues may result in designing inappropriate cognitive systems that may be faced with a wide range of problems such as hacking and failure. CIoT inherited numerous challenges from artificial intelligence, IoT, and cognitive systems. Therefore, the challenges of these fields should be studied to extract the challenges in designing CIoT. In the literature, there is no study on extracting the challenges considering associated technologies to CIoT. In this paper, the challenges of the associated technologies are summarized. Then, some important challenges in designing CIoT are obtained.",

abstract="This study focuses on modeling perspective taking behavior during collaborative explanation activities and the process of searching for relevant knowledge for constructive interaction. A laboratory experiment was conducted where dyads learned about concepts and engaged in a reasoning task using concept maps through discussions. We collected leaners conversational data and gaze using two eye trackers to examine perspective taking behavior. The results showed that leaners who considered others' diverse perspective expeditiously reflected upon their own knowledge and used the relevant knowledge for explaining the phenomenon to their partners. To further model the process of the perspective taking behavior and knowledge retrieval that occurred in the experiment, we developed a model using the cognitive architecture, Adaptive Control of Thought Rational (ACT-R). We further explained the mechanisms by implementing a model where perspective taking increases the opportunity to search and reconsidering the use common knowledge owing to the discrepancy triggered by diverse perspectives. This paper contributes to model-based research and provides knowledge on capturing the relationships of perspective taking and relevant knowledge retrieval in collaborative learning.",

abstract="Games have been shown to be an effective method for various purposes, from pure entertainment to fostering learning outcomes through serious and game-based learning approaches. However, the design of games is not an easy feat, regardless of whether they are focused on emotional outcomes or learning. There are many components that must be considered during game design, such as pedagogical theories, game elements, player experience, as well as cognitive-affective and sociocultural foundations. The balance of such components is one of the greatest challenges designers, researchers and educators must face in the next few years, especially considering that some of these components and their interactions have been neglected in research until recently, such as the importance of emotions in learning and their temporal influence in moderating player experiences. In the context of serious games, where learning and/or non-entertainment goals are as important as the entertainment itself, addressing this challenge is even more difficult. This work outlines and discusses the complexities of this balancing challenge, suggesting research opportunities related to new design tools and methods that consider all aspects enumerated above.",

abstract="Considered are the questions of designing a system for modeling the reasoning of a cognitive agent, capable of making conclusions based on its knowledge and observations of the external environment, solving problems in a hard enough real-time mode. To work in this mode, the existence of a critical time threshold is established, which is set to solve the problem facing the agent. Exceeding the threshold is fraught with grave, sometimes catastrophic consequences and for the agent is unacceptable. The formal basis of the modeling system (cognitive process control) is a logical system - extended step theory, that combines the concepts of active temporal logic and logical programming. Among the original methods proposed by the authors in the work, an approach to combining the concepts of active logic and logical programming in one logical system should be noted; an approach to constructing a consistent declarative semantics for extended step theory of active logic; a method of formalizing temporal, nonmonotonic reasoning of an agent using extended step theory of active temporal logic; a method of granulating time in a logical system to formalize meta-reasoning. A subclass of temporal logic is considered, oriented to application in real-time systems. Additionally, the issues of managing the agent's cognitive process in hard real-time, eliminating anomalies (unforeseen situations), and applying the temporal logic of branching time are investigated in more detail.",

abstract="This paper presents some preliminary tools for empowering the architecture of autonomous agents by providing it with a complex of strategies for using dependence-based knowledge to select agents for cooperation. In this perspective others are seen as solutions to one's problems, and may be recategorized as resources. Three main objectives are pursued in this work. First, to insert a previously developed theory of dependence in a plausible architecture for cognitive agency, showing the role of dependence-based knowledge with regard to the typical functionalities of agency. Second, this work aims to contributing to distributed systems research, by showing how the structure of dependence in a multi-agent world provides criteria for a rational model of interaction and communication. Third, a problem-driven approach to sociality is adopted, where the problem of why social interaction occurs is raised and some answer is found in the agents' problem solving.",
