abstract = {Various disciplines have examined the many phenomena of metacognition and have produced numerous results, both positive and negative. I discuss some of these aspects of cognition about cognition and the results concerning them from the point of view of the psychologist and the computer scientist, and I attempt to place them in the context of computational theories. I examine metacognition with respect to both problem solving (e.g., planning) and to comprehension (e.g., story understanding) processes of cognition.}

abstract = {Metareasoning is an important capability for autonomous systems, particularly for those being deployed on long duration missions. An agent with increased self-observation and the ability to control itself in response to changing environments will be more capable in achieving its goals. This is essential for long-duration missions where system designers will not be able to, theoretically or practically, predict all possible problems that the agent may encounter. In this paper we describe preliminary work that integrates the metacognitive architecture MIDCA with an autonomous TREX agent, creating a more self-observable and adaptive agent.}

This paper considers Metascience as the future, fifth great domain of science, and discusses reasons why metascience may be closely related to metacognition in human intelligence and human-level artificial intelligence, suggesting that the representation and processing which could support an AI systemâ€™s metacognition could also support an AI system reasoning metascientifically about domains of science.}

abstract = {In this paper, an overview of the wide variety of occurrences of mental models in the literature is discussed. They are classified according to two dimensions obtaining four categories of them: static-dynamic and world-mental, where static refers to mental models for static world states or for static mental states and dynamic refers to mental models for world processes or for mental processes. In addition, distinctions are made for what can be done by mental models: they can, for example, be (1) used for internal simulation, they can be (2) adapted, and these processes can be (3) controlled. This leads to a global three-level cognitive architecture covering these three ways of handling mental models. It is discussed that in this cognitive architecture reflection principles play an important role to define the interactions between the different levels.}

abstract = {This paper describes how meta-cognitive processes (i.e., the self monitoring and regulating of cognitive processes) may be captured within a cognitive architecture Clarion. Some currently popular cognitive architectures lack sufficiently complex built-in meta-cognitive mechanisms. However, a sufficiently complex meta-cognitive mechanism is important, in that it is an essential part of cognition and without it, human cognition may not function properly. We contend that such a meta-cognitive mechanism should be an integral part of a cognitive architecture. Thus, such a mechanism has been developed within the Clarion cognitive architecture. The paper demonstrates how human data of two meta-cognitive experiments are simulated using Clarion. The simulations show that the meta-cognitive processes represented by the experimental data (and beyond) can be adequately captured within the Clarion framework.}
