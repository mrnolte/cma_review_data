abstract = {The Recognition-Primed Decision (RPD) framework is a naturalistic decision making model that focuses on how people actually make decisions in realistic settings that typically involve ill-structured problems. In this paper, we generalize the existing studies on RPD and propose a Team-RPD representation model that treats a situation as a layered organization of state variables, and the decision process as a timed transition Petri net. This model can serve as a foundation for implementing agent architectures and multi-agent systems with built-in supports for naturalistic decision making.},

abstract = {In this report we consider the current status of the coverage of computer science in education at the lowest levels of education in multiple countries. Our focus is on computational thinking (CT), a term meant to encompass a set of concepts and thought processes that aid in formulating problems and their solutions in different fields in a way that could involve computers [130].The main goal of this report is to help teachers, those involved in teacher education, and decision makers to make informed decisions about how and when CT can be included in their local institutions. We begin by defining CT and then discuss the current state of CT in K-9 education in multiple countries in Europe as well as the United States. Since many students are exposed to CT outside of school, we also discuss the current state of informal educational initiatives in the same set of countries.An important contribution of the report is a survey distributed to K-9 teachers, aiming at revealing to what extent different aspects of CT are already part of teachers' classroom practice and how this is done. The survey data suggest that some teachers are already involved in activities that have strong potential for introducing some aspects of CT. In addition to the examples given by teachers participating in the survey, we present some additional sample activities and lesson plans for working with aspects of CT in different subjects. We also discuss ways in which teacher training can be coordinated as well as the issue of repositories. We conclude with future directions for research in CT at school.},

abstract = {We define and describe the academic studio model for interdisciplinary, undergraduate, project-oriented education. This model brings faculty, students, and community partners together to investigate an open-ended academic question, and their collaboration yields an original product that represents their inquiry. The academic studio integrates agile software development practice, project-oriented pedagogy, and sociocultural cognition theories. Scrum provides the framework in which self-organizing, cross-functional teams define their methodology, and Scrum practices facilitate assessment of student learning outcomes.This model emerged from design-based research across six studio instances, each of which investigated the relationship of fun, games, and learning through the development of educational video games. Formal and informal analysis of these instances gives rise to several themes, including the importance of a formalized process to encourage learning and productivity, the critical role of an expert faculty mentor, the need to combine academic and industrial practice to manage the inherent challenges of collaborative software development, and the unique characteristics of learning outcomes arising from this model. We conclude that the academic studio model is beneficial to student learning and faculty development, and we encourage the adoption, adaptation, and evaluation of the model.},

abstract = {In programming education, explicit strategies are gaining traction. The reason for this study was to improve an introductory programming course based on a problem-based methodology, by using more explicit programming strategies. After analysing a previous run of this course for first year undergraduate students, we concluded that such strategies could improve learning transfer for students across the different weeks of the semester. We introduced four instructional strategies to tutors with close to no pedagogical background: explicit tracing, subgoal labeled worked examples, Parsons problems and explicit problem solving. These explicit programming strategies aim to decrease cognitive load. Tutors tested these four strategies in the course.Our goal was to explore how tutors could benefit in their tutoring from explicit strategies. Interviews with the tutors show that the easiest and most effective of the tested strategies were best used. For the more elaborate strategies, more time should be devoted to explain and model them or they can be misunderstood and misapplied.We conclude that four criteria are key to successfully using an explicit strategy: easy to understand, straightforward to apply, useful on the long term and supported by literature.},

abstract = {For many decades, educational communities, including computing education, have debated the value of telling students what they need to know (i.e., direct instruction) compared to guiding them to construct knowledge themselves (i.e., constructivism). Comparisons of these two instructional approaches have inconsistent results. Direct instruction can be more efficient for short-term performance but worse for retention and transfer. Constructivism can produce better retention and transfer, but this outcome is unreliable. To contribute to this debate, we propose a new theory to better explain these research results. Our theory, multiple conceptions theory, states that learners develop better conceptual knowledge when they are guided to compare multiple conceptions of a concept during instruction. To examine the validity of this theory, we used this lens to evaluate the literature for eight instructional techniques that guide learners to compare multiple conceptions, four from direct instruction (i.e., test-enhanced learning, erroneous examples, analogical reasoning, and refutation texts) and four from constructivism (i.e., productive failure, ambitious pedagogy, problem-based learning, and inquiry learning). We specifically searched for variations in the techniques that made them more or less successful, the mechanisms responsible, and how those mechanisms promote conceptual knowledge, which is critical for retention and transfer. To make the paper directly applicable to education, we propose instructional design principles based on the mechanisms that we identified. Moreover, we illustrate the theory by examining instructional techniques commonly used in computing education that compare multiple conceptions. Finally, we propose ways in which this theory can advance our instruction in computing and how computing education researchers can advance this general education theory.},

Following up on the successful in-person conference held last year in Sweden, this year's theme is "HRI in the Real World," and focuses on advances that aim to bring human-robot interaction out of the lab and into everyday life.One aspect of this that we are very excited about is the introduction of a robot challenge to the conference activities, where teams from around the world will showcase their research and development via actual, interactive robots in the "real world" of an academic conference. It is our hope that this feature will grow and develop over the coming years into a staple of the HRI conference.This year's HRI conference saw an impressive surge in global interest, with 352 full paper submissions from around the world, marking a significant 40\% increase compared to the previous year. These papers were categorized under relevant thematic subcommittees and underwent a double-blind review process, a rebuttal phase, and selective shepherding by the HRI program committee. From this process, 87 outstanding papers (24.7\%) were chosen for full presentation at the conference. Reflecting our joint sponsorship with IEEE and ACM, all accepted papers will be accessible in the ACM Digital Library and IEEE Xplore.},

While we are sure that there will be a few surprises along the way, we hope and expect that we won't experience anything nearly as disruptive as the opening days of the pandemic, which occurred when we last tried to gather here in 2020.Our theme for this year's symposium is "Blazing New Trails in CS Education." This broad theme captures the exceptional work being performed by this community to enhance our teaching, improve our assessments, attract diverse students, and all of the other laudable projects, initiatives, and undertakings that affect positive change. The breadth of the program is substantial - there truly should be something for everyone. In fact, your biggest challenge may be deciding which session to attend in each time slot because there is so much going on! We know that many of you want to attend as many sessions as possible while you are here in Portland, but we encourage you to also find a little bit of time for yourself so that you leave Portland refreshed, renewed and encouraged, rather than exhausted or burnt out.},

abstract = {Previous research indicates that students' adaptation to task complexity in the planning stages of self-regulated learning are related to their epistemological beliefs (Stahl, Pieschl, \&amp; Bromme, 2006), but it is an open issue if students enact similar strategies in subsequent stages. Based on the COPES-model (Winne \&amp; Hadwin, 1998) the impact of epistemological beliefs on learning is tested here experimentally. In this study, students (21 humanities students, 14 biology students) had to solve five tasks of different complexity (Anderson et al., 2001) with a hypertext on "genetic fingerprinting". Results indicate that students adapted their concurrent thoughts and concurrent actions to task complexity in this enactment stage. An epistemological sensitisation was administered that elicited more "sophisticated" beliefs and caused more elaborate learning processes. For example, students with this sensitisation employed more metacognitive planning, especially for more complex tasks. Additionally, effects of prior domain knowledge were investigated.},

abstract = {Several areas of multi-agent research, such as large-scale agent organization and experience-based decision making, demand novel perspectives and efficient approaches for multiscale information analysis. A recent breakthrough in harmonic analysis is diffusion geometry and diffusion wavelets, which offers a general framework for multiscale analysis of massive data sets. In this paper, we introduce the "diffusion" concept into the MAS field, and investigate the impacts of using diffusion distance on the performance of solution synthesis in experience-based multi-agent decision making. In particular, we take a two-dimensional perspective to explore the use of diffusion distance and Euclidean distance in identifying 'similar' experiences--a key activity in the process of recognition-primed decision making. An experiment has been conducted on a data set including a large collection of battlefield decision experiences. It is shown that the performance of using diffusion distance can be significantly better than using Euclidean distance in the original experience space. This study allows us to generalize an anytime algorithm for multi-agent decision making, and it also opens the door to the application of diffusion geometry to multiagent research involving massive data analysis.},

abstract = {In crowded environments, the shortest path for an autonomous robot navigator may not be the best choice - another plan that avoids crowded areas might be preferable. Such a crowd-sensitive path planner, however, requires knowledge about the crowd's global behavior. This paper formulates a Bayesian approach that relies only on an onboard range scanner to learn a global crowd model online. Two new algorithms, CUSUM-A* and Risk-A*, use local observations to continuously update the crowd model. CUSUM-A* tracks the spatio-temporal changes in the crowd; Risk-A* adjusts for changes in navigation cost due to human-robot interactions. Extensive evaluation in a challenging simulated environment demonstrates that both algorithms generate plans that significantly reduce their proximity to moving obstacles, and thereby protect people from actuator error and inspire their trust in the robot.},
