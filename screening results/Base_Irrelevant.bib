A number of researchers define "metacognition" as {\textquotedblleft}knowing what one knows." Others define it more broadly as a set of abilities allowing an individual to control and monitor his/her own cognitive activity" {\textendash} where "cognitive activity" is taken to mean "activity with an informational goal." Developmental, neuroscientific and comparative studies, however, show that cognitive agents can pursue informational goals and reliably monitor them without representing their own mental states as mental states: they enjoy "procedural" metacognition. Various objections raised in the literature against this hypothesis are discussed, such as the kind of reinforcement at work in metacognition, and the role of metacognitive awareness in human and nonhuman decision-making. Finally, Peter Carruthers{\textquoteright} first-order account of the comparative and developmental evidence of metacognition in terms of "basic questioning" is compared with the account in terms of procedural metacognition.}},

Metacognition involves processes that monitor and enhance cognition. Learning how to learn - metacognitive learning - is crucial for adapting and optimizing learning strategies over time. Although LLMs possess limited metacognitive abilities, they cannot autonomously refine or optimize these strategies. Humans possess innate mechanisms for metacognitive learning that enable at least two unique abilities: discerning which metacognitive strategies are best and automatizing learning strategies. These processes have been effectively modeled in the ACT-R cognitive architecture, providing insights on a path toward greater learning autonomy in AI. Incorporating human-like metacognitive learning abilities into AI could potentially lead to the development of more autonomous and versatile learning mechanisms, as well as improved problem-solving capabilities and performance across diverse tasks.}},

Goals are of primary importance for our analysis since they relate anticipatory mechanisms, representations, and future-oriented conducts. internal models, anticipatory representations and goal-directed behavior have always been related in the analysis of cognitive systems.}},

Theoretical interpretation was long dominated by associative interpretations, a conservative approach well illustrated in the 2009 special issue of animal metacognition in Comparative Cognition and Behavioral Reviews. We suggest, though, that this approach risks a self-limiting understanding of animal minds, and an imprecise understanding of the cognitive requirements inherent in metacognition tasks. In fact, some tasks self-entail the need for higher-level decision-making processes, processes that{\textemdash}in humans{\textemdash}we would call explicit, declarative, and conscious. These points are illustrated using the inaugural study on dolphin metacognition. We urge researchers to turn more toward illuminating the cognitive architecture of capacities like metacognition, including illuminating the depth, and structure, the learning/memory systems, the cognitive levels, and the declarative awareness possibly present in animals{\textquoteright} minds. The empirical development of this literature demonstrates that researchers are now prepared to do so. This study can produce strong synergies across the allied fields of biopsychology, comparative and cognitive psychology, and neuroscience.}},

note = {{Description: Cognitive modeling is a methodology of cognitive sciences that allows the simulation of human cognitive processes in a variety forms, commonly in a computational and mathematical way. The cognitive modeling aims at understanding cognition basis by designing cognitive models based on mathematical or computational processes, mechanisms and representations. A cognitive model is a verbal-conceptual computational and mathematical description of some mental processes, whose main purpose is to understand and/or predict human or animal behavior. Cognitive models developed for a cognitive architecture are characterized by being executables and producing a set of specific behaviors. CARINA is a metacognitive architecture to create artificial intelligent agents derived from Metacognitive Metamodel MISM. CARINA is a metacognitive architecture structured by two cognitive levels called object-level and meta-level. The object-level has the model of the world to solve problems. The meta-level represents the reasoning of an artificial intelligent agent. Furthermore, the meta-level has the components, the knowledge and the mechanisms for an intelligent system to monitor and control its own learning and reasoning processes. The main objective of this research project is to develop cognitive models as knowledge acquisition mechanisms for the metacognitive architecture CARINA, through the following specific objectives: i) to represent formal, semantic and computationally cognitive models for the CARINA metacognitive architecture, ii) to build a functional prototype of a framework for the creation of cognitive models in the metacognitive architecture CARINA and iii) to create cognitive models in several knowledge domains using CARINA based intelligent systems. The methodology used for this research project was part of the research methods (R+D) used in computer science, called modeling, structured by five steps: i) Formal representation, ii) Semantic representation, iii) Computational representation of a cognitive model, iv) Creation ...}},

The lineage of the principles of explicit instruction can be traced from research on large-scale school reform projects through a range of research and theoretical approaches based on cognitive, information-processing models of how the mind learns. Cognitive load theory provides a highly informative theoretical framework in which explicit instruction can be embedded. In relating explicit instructional practices to cognitive load theory, explicit instruction can be operationalized in terms of the load reduction instruction framework and is associated with reduced intrinsic and extraneous loads. A robust evidence base supports the effects of explicit instruction on learning, as well as other educational outcomes such as motivation and engagement, metacognition and self-regulated learning, problem-solving, critical thinking, and creativity. The effectiveness of explicit instruction depends on changing the amount and type of explicit instruction throughout the learning process. Explicit instruction contrasts with constructivist perspectives, but under certain circumstances, explicit instructional approaches can and should incorporate elements of strategies typically regarded as constructivist principles and strategies.}},

note = {{Description: Metacognition is the process of thinking about thinking. It provides cognitive systems the ability to note and deal with anomalies, changes, opportunities, surprises and uncertainty. It includes both monitoring of cognitive activities and control of such activities. Monitoring helps to evaluate and explain the cognitive activities, while control helps to adapt or modify the cognitive activities. Situated agents are agents embedded in a dynamic environment that they can sense or perceive and manipulate or change through their actions. Similarly, they can act in order to manipulate other agents among which they are situated. Examples might include robots, natural language dialog interfaces, web-based agents or virtual-reality bots. An agent can leverage metacognition of its own thinking about other agents in its situated environment. It can equally benefit from metacognition of the thinking of other agents towards itself. Metacognitive monitoring can help situated agents in negotiations, conflict resolution and norm-awareness. Metacognitive control can help coordination and coalition formations of situated social agents. In this workshop, we investigate the monitoring and control aspects of metacognition about self and other agents, and their application to situated artificial agents. The papers in this report cover some of the current work related to metacognition in the areas of meta-knowledge representation, meta-reasoning and meta-cognitive architecture. Perlis et al. outlines a high-level view of architectures for real-time situated agents and the reliance of such agents on metacognition.
