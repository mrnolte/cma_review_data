Abstract = {Metacognition has been used in artificial intelligence to increase the
   level of autonomy of intelligent systems. However, the design of systems
   with metacognitive capabilities is a difficult task due to the number
   and complexity of processes involved. The main objective of this article
   is to introduce a novel metacognitive architecture for monitoring and
   control of reasoning failures in artificial intelligent agents. CARINA
   metacognitive architecture is based on precise definitions of structural
   and functional elements of metacognition as defined in the MISM
   meta-model. CARINA can be used to implement real-world cognitive agents
   with the capability for introspective monitoring and meta-level control.
   Introspective monitoring detects reasoning failure (for example, when
   expectation is violated). Metacognitive control selects strategies to
   recover from failures. The article demonstrates a CARINA implementation
   of reasoning failure detection and recovery in an intelligent tutoring
   system called FUNPRO.},

Abstract = {This paper describes how meta-cognitive processes (i.e., the self
   monitoring and regulating of cognitive processes) may be captured within
   a cognitive architecture CLARION. Some currently popular cognitive
   architectures lack sufficiently complex built-in meta-cognitive
   mechanisms. However, a sufficiently complex meta-cognitive mechanism is
   important, in that it is an essential part of cognition and without it,
   human cognition may not function properly. We contend that such a
   meta-cognitive mechanism should be an integral part of a cognitive
   architecture. Thus, such a mechanism has been developed within the
   CLARION cognitive architecture. The paper demonstrates how human data of
   two meta-cognitive experiments are simulated using CLARION. The
   simulations show that the meta-cognitive processes represented by the
   experimental data ( and beyond) can be adequately captured within the
   CLARION framework. (c) 2005 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {To construct a perpetual self-aware cognitive agent that can
   continuously operate with independence, an introspective machine must be
   produced. To assemble such an agent, it is necessary to perform a full
   integration of cognition (planning, understanding, and learning) and
   metacognition (control and monitoring of cognition) with intelligent
   behaviors. The failure to do this completely is why similar, more
   limited efforts have not succeeded in the past. I outline some key
   computational requirements of metacognition by describing a
   multi-strategy learning system called Meta-AQUA and then discuss an
   integration of Meta-AQUA with a nonlinear state-space planning agent. I
   show how the resultant system, INTRO, can independently generate its own
   goals, and I relate this work to the general issue of self-awareness by
   machine.},

Abstract = {This paper discusses, in the context of computational modelling and
   simulation of cognition, the relevance of deeper structures in the
   control of behaviour. Such deeper structures include motivational
   control of behaviour, which provides underlying causes for actions, and
   also metacognitive control, which provides higher-order processes for
   monitoring and regulation. It is argued that such deeper structures are
   important and thus cannot be ignored in computational cognitive
   architectures. A general framework based on the Clarion cognitive
   architecture is outlined that emphasises the interaction amongst action
   selection, motivation, and metacognition. The upshot is that it is
   necessary to incorporate all essential processes; short of that, the
   understanding of cognition can only be incomplete.},
