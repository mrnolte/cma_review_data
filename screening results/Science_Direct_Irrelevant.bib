abstract = {Four working steps taken from a comprehensive empirical model of expert abstracting are studied in order to prepare an explorative implementation of a simulation model. It aims at explaining the knowledge processing activities during professional summarizing. Following the case-based and holistic strategy of qualitative empirical research, we develop the main features of the simulation system by investigating in detail a small but central test case—four working steps where an expert abstractor discovers what the paper is about and drafts the topic sentence of the abstract. Following the KADS methodology of knowledge engineering, our discussion begins with the empirical model (a conceptual model in KADS terms) and aims at a computational model which is implementable without determining the concrete implementation tools (the design model according to KADS). The envisaged solution uses a blackboard system architecture with cooperating object-oriented agents representing cognitive strategies and a dynamic text representation which borrows its conceptual relations in particular from RST (Rhetorical Structure Theory). As a result of the discussion we feel that a small simulation model of professional summarizing is feasible.}

abstract = {Goal reasoning is the ability of an artificial system to reason over its goals; it can identify, manage, plan, and execute its goals. In complex environments where requirements could change often, goal reasoning functionality is essential. Goal reasoning agents may rely on a motivation system to guide the goal reasoning process; we refer to such agents as motivated agents. Motivated agents can be explicitly or implicitly motivated by external or internal motivations. While the bulk of goal reasoning work has focused on agents that have implicit external motivations, internal motivations may offer some unique benefits to goal reasoning. As artificial internal motivations have a natural analogue to the human motivation system, this work investigates recent advances in motivated agents, where motivations are modeled on the human integrated-self. In this survey, we review those goal reasoning systems whose meta-reasoning and other goal reasoning subprocesses are at least in part intrinsic or identified, i.e., arising from idiosyncratic factors such as identity, a value system, emotions, experiences and so forth. For each system surveyed we evaluate its goal reasoning processes according to an analysis framework. We use our findings to draw conclusions about the potential benefits the three self-system categories: motives, mental simulation, and emotion bring to the goal reasoning paradigm.}

We show that a cognitive architecture by itself can serve as a generic model of personality, without any significant addition or modification. A cognitive architecture can capture the fundamental invariance within an individual in terms of behavioral inclinations as well as the inevitable variability of behaviors. Various tests and simulations have been conducted within the cognitive architecture that show that such a model is reasonably stable, is relatively flexible (in terms of person–situation interactions), captures some major personality traits (e.g., the Five-Factor Model), and accounts for a variety of empirical data. The work shows the feasibility and usefulness of integrating personality modeling with generic computational cognitive modeling (i.e., cognitive architectures).}

abstract = {The problem of goal recognition requests to automatically infer an accurate probability distribution over possible goals an autonomous agent is attempting to achieve in the environment. The state-of-the-art approaches for goal recognition operate under full knowledge of the environment and possible operations the agent can take. This knowledge, however, is often not available in real-world applications. Given historical observations of the agents' behaviors in the environment, we learn skill models that capture how the agents achieved the goals in the past. Next, given fresh observations of an agent, we infer their goals by diagnosing deviations between the observations and all the available skill models. We present a framework that serves as an outline for implementing such data-driven goal recognition systems and its instance system implemented using process mining techniques. The evaluations we conducted using our publicly available implementation confirm that the approach is well-defined, i.e., all system parameters impact its performance, has high accuracy over a wide range of synthetic and real-world domains, which is comparable with the more knowledge-demanding state-of-the-art approaches, and operates fast.}

While symbolic methods, both empirical and knowledge intensive (in particular, inductive concept learning and explanation-based methods), continued to be exceedingly active (see Parts Two and Three of the book, respectively), subsymbolic approaches, especially neural networks, have experienced tremendous growth (Part Five). Unlike past efforts that concentrated on single learning strategies, the new trends have been to integrate different strategies and to develop cognitive learning architectures (Part Four). There has been an increasing interest in experimental comparisons of various methods, and in theoretical analyses of learning algorithms. Researchers have been sharing the same data sets and have applied their techniques to the same problems in order to understand the relative merits of different methods. Theoretical investigations have brought new insights into the complexity of learning processes (Part Six). This chapter gives a brief account of the recent progress and prospective research directions in the field, attempts to clarify some basic concepts, proposes a multicriteria classification of learning methods, and concludes with a brief description of each chapter.}

abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming embedded in all forms of advanced technologies. A recent, new wave of machine learning-based AI has promised great advances; however, experience has taught that technology alone is not sufficient to prevent, avert, and manage global crises. Pandemics can cripple economies and societies and disrupt the course of history at an unprecedented rate and scale, and no AI is likely to change that. The COVID-19 pandemic is the most current example of this type of situation, prompting a reevaluation of the role of technology, delivering an opportunity to carry out an important reality check of the overall state of the art in AI and test in real-world scenarios the usefulness and effectiveness of existing technologies, as well as generalize the new lessons that are being learned to make them applicable to future events. Despite advances in intelligent systems, the role of AI in preventing and alleviating the effects of widespread global crises such as pandemics is still limited. No known AI can restore the breath of life in patients affected by severe health failures. Some applications, however, such as AI-based high-throughput screening could alleviate the workload of medical personnel, and that feature alone could potentially save lives, especially when the cognitive states of even the most skilled health workers are less than optimal due to overwork and stress. This chapter discusses selected issues in global epidemics and AI, with examples from the COVID-19 pandemic and against a backdrop of relevant foundational topics such as sociotechnical complexity. It introduces and explains system-level knowledge representation and how this relies on interoperable data formats, pointing to the current limitations and desirable future developments. It includes a reflection on our understanding of intelligence. This chapter intends to serve as a reminder of the vulnerability of our society, of the fragility of life, of the fallibility of human and technical systems.}

To be widely accepted, such an interface should not put additional cognitive load at the end-user, it should be reliable and minimally invasive. In this paper we present a one such interface based on a robust method for detecting and recognizing motor actions from a low-cost wearable sensor network mounted on a sound leg providing inertial (accelerometer, gyrometer and magnetometer) data in real-time. We assume that the sensor measurement trajectories – in a given temporal window – can be represented as the output of a linear time invariant system. We describe such set of trajectories via a Hankel matrix, which embeds the observability matrix of the LTI system generating the set of trajectories. The use of Hankel matrices (known as Hankelets) avoids the burden of performing system identification while providing a computationally convenient descriptor for the dynamics of a time-series. For the recognition of actions, we use two off-the-shelf classifiers, nearest neighbor (NN) and support vector machines (SVM), in cross-subject validation. We present results using either the joint angles or the raw sensor data showing a net improvement of the Hankelet-based approach against a baseline method. In addition, we compare results on action recognition using joint angles provided by trakSTAR, a high-accuracy motion tracking unit, demonstrating – somewhat surprisingly – that best results (in terms of average recognition accuracy over different actions) are provided by raw inertial data, paving the way towards a wider usage of our method in the field of active prosthetics, in particular, and motor intention recognition, in general.}

One such challenge to the promotion of deeper processing is the Disfluency Effect. Specifically, disfluency manipulations in learning materials interfere with the perceptional fluency, which may in turn lead to better learning outcomes. This likelihood of reaching better learning outcomes through minor instructional modifications has led scholars to investigate the construct further. Accordingly, the effect of fluency modifications on learning outcomes, metacognitive judgments and cognitive load is investigated in the current study with a true experiment conducted with 292 undergraduate students who were assigned randomly to one of the six disfluency scenarios in a computer-based learning environment. Additional variables were also considered such as the working memory capacity, prior knowledge and cognitive load. Significant differences were observed with regard to the extraneous cognitive load, while there was no variation in the learning outcomes and metacognitive judgments in the experimental groups. Moreover, significant relationships were observed between cognitive load, the number of animations watched by the students and the learning outcomes. The results were interpreted in accordance with the approach in contemporary studies into the Disfluency Effect, and theoretical and practical implications are discussed.}

abstract = {This paper presents an Augmented Reality (AR)-based network cabling tutoring system that trains users how to interconnect cables within a Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN) on a physical switching rack. AR arrows combined with text-based instruction and a checklist provided assistance during practical learning. When learners made a mistake, an Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) identified the source of the mistake and provided real-time feedback using text, AR and text-to-speech mechanisms. The design was motivated by the human-cognitive architecture and its five evolutionary principles (proposed by Sweller and Sweller (2006)). Users performed four consecutive network cabling training tasks with assistance from our ITS. We found that users made fewer errors when the AR cues, text-based instruction and checklist solutions were replaced with summarised information and then removed completely in the final task compared to those who used an identical system with fixed instruction. Cognitive Load Theory (CLT) explains our results by suggesting that the instructional mechanisms become redundant as knowledge increases. Implications of the study are discussed as well as how AR can help facilitate knowledge transfer in the network cabling domain.}

The study involved multimodal data involving video and electrodermal activities (EDA) data collected from ninety-four secondary school students (N = 94) during five science lessons to reveal trigger events in CL. A novel concept of trigger events is introduced, which are challenging events and/or situations that may inhibit collaboration and will, therefore, require strategic adaptation in the regulation of cognition, motivation, and emotion within the group. The ANOVA results for the Skin Conductance Responses (SCRs) analysis indicated the disparity of physiological behavior activated in relation to different types of interactions for regulation. Process analysis and episode-rule mining were applied to reveal regulatory patterns in CL, while an AI approach with long short-term memory (LSTM) deep-learning networks were designed for pattern prediction. LSTM has emerged as the most widely applied artificial recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture for sequential data analysis and classification. The proposed AI network holds the potential for designing solutions for similar signal-processing problems in studying learning regulation. This study contributes to developing AI-enabled real-time support for regulation in collaborative learning.}

According to the proposed explication, a core subset of emotions including surprise are nonconceptual products of hardwired mechanisms whose primary function is to subserve the monitoring and updating of the central representational system of humans, the belief–desire system. The posited emotion-producing mechanisms are analogous to sensory transducers; however, instead of sensing the world, they sense the state of the belief–desire system and signal important changes in this system, in particular the fulfillment and frustration of desires and the confirmation and disconfirmation of beliefs. Because emotions represent this information about the state of the representational system in a nonconceptual format, emotions are nonconceptual metarepresentations. It is argued that this theory of emotions provides for a deepened understanding of the role of emotions in cognitive systems and solves several problems of psychological emotion theory.}

This is an important issue because video annotation systems are gaining popularity in the practice of online and blended learning, but the conditions for effective implementation of such systems are still not well understood. This study explored the influence of video annotation conditions upon metacomprehension accuracy and learning performance with a group of 81 undergraduate students of various majors. Findings suggest that video annotation systems designed for simultaneous notetaking may have a deleterious effect upon metacognitive monitoring in general and metacomprehension in particular. Text-based strategies used to improve metacomprehension accuracy such as a delay in the production of a keyword to summarize the essence of an instructional topic do not appear to impact metacognitive performance in the context of video annotation. Interestingly, participants in the control condition (without annotation) performed as well in both learning performance and metacomprehension accuracy as their counterparts. These findings have implications for the design of video annotation systems and learner best practices in the use of video annotation, particularly in online and blended learning formats.}

This advantage is hindered in non-optimal situations where experts' schemas are sometimes not applicable and may show same or higher cognitive load than novices. Further investigations were, however, needed to unravel the mechanisms at stake in real-life situations. We investigated expert train travelers in normal versus disturb condition using immersion in a virtual environment of a Parisian train station: Saint-Michel Notre Dame. Our aim was to determine how cognitive load varies according to expertise level of travelers. We measured skin conductance responses for physiological analysis, NASA-Task Load Index for subjective analysis, and factual and spatiotemporal contextual memory investigation for behavioral analysis. As expected, expert travelers showed lower cognitive load than novices in normal but not in disturb condition. In fact, an expertise reversal effect was observed in disturb context, characterized by higher cognitive load in experts for subjective and physiological measures, and a lower temporal memory performance. These alterations are believed to be associated with high cognitive load needed for inhibiting the automatized schemas. We provide a novel insight in expertise reversal effect, during navigation in an everyday life activity.}

Sparse distributed memory (SDM) is a content-addressable memory technique that relies on close memory items tending to be clustered together. In this work, we used an enhanced version of SDM augmented with the use of genetic algorithms as an associative memory in our ‘conscious’ software agent, CMattie, who is responsible for emailing seminar announcements in an academic department. Interacting with seminar organizers via email in natural language, CMattie can replace the secretary who normally handles such announcements. SDM is a key ingredient in a complex agent architecture that implements global workspace theory, a psychological theory of consciousness and cognition. In this architecture, SDM, as the primary memory for the agent, provides associations with incoming percepts. These include disambiguation of the percept by removing noise, correcting misspellings, and adding missing pieces of information. It also retrieves behaviors and emotions associated with the percept. These associations are based on previous similar percepts, and their consequences, that have been recorded earlier. SDM also possesses several key psychological features. Some enhancements to SDM including multiple writes of important items, use of error detection and correction, and the use of hashing to map the original information into fixed size keys were used. Test results indicate that SDM can be used successfully as an associative memory in such complex agent architectures. The results show that SDM is capable of recovering a percept based on a part of that percept, and finding defaults for empty perception registers. The evaluation of suggested actions and emotional states is satisfactory. We think that this work opens the door to more scientific and empirical uses for SDM.}

Two kinds of externalist theories deserve to be sharply distinguished. The first is The Extended Scientific Mind, which is an application of The Extended Mind to scientific contexts. According to this externalist theory, the cognitive systems responsible for a scientist’s inferences can extend into her extra-cranial environment and incorporate elements with which she is intimately coupled. The second kind of externalist theory is a population-level theory of scientific cognition, which characterizes the dynamics of populations and communities of scientific researchers. Externalist theories of this type posit cognitive properties of these population-level dynamics that are not necessarily instantiated by any individual scientist who is a member of such populations. I argue that population-level theories of scientific cognition are more plausible than The Extended Scientific Mind because the latter posits cognitive systems that are explanatorily unwarranted. On the assumption that non-scientific cognition and scientific cognition are fundamentally alike, a similar moral holds for externalist accounts of ordinary cognition.}

Nevertheless, some concerns have recently been raised with regard to the sufficiency of current embodied AI for advancing our scientific understanding of intentional agency. While from an engineering or computer science perspective this limitation might not be relevant, it is of course highly relevant for AI researchers striving to build accurate models of natural cognition. We argue that the biological foundations of enactive cognitive science can provide the conceptual tools that are needed to diagnose more clearly the shortcomings of current embodied AI. In particular, taking an enactive perspective points to the need for AI to take seriously the organismic roots of autonomous agency and sense-making. We identify two necessary systemic requirements, namely constitutive autonomy and adaptivity, which lead us to introduce two design principles of enactive AI. It is argued that the development of such enactive AI poses a significant challenge to current methodologies. However, it also provides a promising way of eventually overcoming the current limitations of embodied AI, especially in terms of providing fuller models of natural embodied cognition. Finally, some practical implications and examples of the two design principles of enactive AI are also discussed.}

Human communication is currently defined as a circular and overt attempt to modify a partner’s mental states. This requires each party involved to possess the ability to represent and understand the other’s mental states, a capability which is commonly referred to as mindreading, or theory of mind (ToM). The relevant experimental literature agrees that no such capability is to be found in the human species at least during the first year of life, and possibly later. This paper aims at advancing a solution to this theoretical problem. We propose to consider sharedness as the basis for intentional communication in the infant and to view it as a primitive, innate component of her cognitive architecture. Communication can then build upon the mental grounds that the infant takes as shared with her caregivers. We view this capability as a theory of mind in a weak sense.}

Good cooperation between health care (HC) professionals, patient, and family is indispensable during homecare as mentioned in reports and analyses from different countries. In a French National project named coordination for the quality of care (COQUAS), we aimed to address the problem of improving such cooperation with current tools and techniques. We hypothesized that, as in some other domains, a better integration of use and users in informatics systems could improve the usefulness of the cooperative tool. The first part of this paper is devoted to the cognitive analysis of the homecare process and highlights the requirements which should be met according to this analysis. We describe some specific features of asynchronous cooperation and some communication issues in the cooperation of HC workers. We then detail the analysis of the homecare process: methodology, description of the processes, cognitive activity analyses, and of the requirements which flow from this analysis. The second part of this paper proposes a framework and then describes a modular system prototype, designed to take into account these requirements, including aspects of both cooperation and interoperability. It uses a meta-description of actions and information derived from a cognitive study to build dynamically the interface settings; it respects the current trend in distributed architecture and uses XML communication of messages, manages complex coordination with a workflow and allows mobile work. The last part of the paper presents the evaluation which has been done with the implemented prototype, with actual homecare users.}

abstract = {Many approaches were proposed to model complex socially emotional behavior in virtual actors, such as intelligent tutors, creative assistants, or team partners. They still lack the ‘magic’ of human-level cognition: systems built for one paradigm appear clueless outside of its boundary. Natural cognitive systems, on the other hand, can adapt to unexpected environments and paradigms. To capture the robustness of natural cognitive development, a new approach is proposed here that enables the formation of new higher cognitive abilities in a model system, embedded in an unexpected environment. This is achieved based on the naturally developing grounding of innate abstract constructs (schemas). The mechanism producing this binding is that of creative insight. In this study, principles of insight processes borrowed from psychology are formalized and adapted for computer modeling. To do this, several examples of insight phenomena at different evolutionary levels and in different species are analyzed before the model is formulated based on the dual process theory, the signal model of insight, and the eBICA cognitive architecture framework. Results of its computer simulations prove the concept. One specific finding is that the accumulation of activation during the incubation period increases creative abilities of the system. It is argued that the proposed approach can explain a range of facts and mysteries associated with the human cognitive ontogeny and can provide the basis for a self-sustained evolution of future Artificial Intelligence.}

abstract = {Publisher Summary
The integrity of the process of eliciting and representing human expertise is fundamental to any knowledge-based system. This process is referred to as “knowledge acquisition.” Human expertise can be found in documents and databases that store records of past transactions as well as the guidelines and procedures used to process those transactions. An active area of current research involves “mining” these data to capture knowledge to develop rules for incorporation into knowledge-based systems. This chapter presents a thorough review of current practice in eliciting, representing, and amalgamating knowledge from multiple experts with a focus on the use of graphical representations to support the process. The important points of the discussion are illustrated by presenting a specific methodology for eliciting and combining knowledge from multiple experts. This methodology provides a statistically defensive summarization for assessment. The results of a pilot test of its implementation over the Internet are also presented in the chapter. This chapter concludes with a discussion on the need for knowledge acquisition techniques that permit the quality of the rules developed based on the acquired knowledge to be quantitatively assessed and subsequently embedded into decision support systems.}
