Abstract = {This article considers the cognitive architecture of human
   meta-reasoning: that is, metacognition concerning one's own reasoning
   and decision-making. The view we defend is that meta-reasoning is a
   cobbled-together skill comprising diverse self-management strategies
   acquired through individual and cultural learning. These approximate the
   monitoring-and-control functions of a postulated adaptive system for
   metacognition by recruiting mechanisms that were designed for quite
   other purposes.},

Abstract = {Humans seek to select the best decision for a given problem in a process
   that is highly efficient and often ends with success. This is due to a
   high-order thinking skill: metacognition, which enables humans to be
   successful decision makers by constantly monitoring their cognitive
   activities based on earlier experience. Besides this, the social aspect
   of metacognition helps humans in monitoring their cognitive activities
   based on their peers experience and knowledge. Inspired by this, we
   propose HumanCog: a generic 3-layer architecture for solving
   optimization problems. HumanCog functions in a way that mimics human
   cognitive and metacognitive (self as well as social) behavior. The three
   layers in the network are cognitive layer, metacognitive layer and
   social cognitive layer. These three layers interact with each other such
   that accurate decision is made. As an initial work, we provide a simple
   realization of the HumanCog referred to as HumanCog-ver1, which
   self-regulates decision based on best experience. The performance
   evaluation on CEC 2015 and 2013 benchmark problems indicates promising
   results.},

Abstract = {This theoretical review of Winne and Hadwin's model of self-regulated
   learning (SRL) seeks to highlight how the model sheds new light on
   current research as well as suggests interesting new directions for
   future work. The authors assert that the model's more complex cognitive
   architecture, inclusion of monitoring and control within each phase of
   learning, and separation of task definition and goal setting into
   separate phases are all important contributions to the SRL literature.
   New research directions are outlined, including more nuanced
   interpretations of judgments of learning and the potential to more
   thoroughly assess the influence of interactions among cognitive and task
   conditions on all phases of learning.},
